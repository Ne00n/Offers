But several of our family members demanded that we cater towards the ever so growing Asian clientele.  \r\n\r\n#####  Today, we are excited to announce the 7th addition to Nexus Bytes Global Locations, The Lion City, Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe following product lines are available to deploy in Singapore, effective immediately :\r\n\r\n**AMD Ryzen + Nvme Powered**\r\n- Premium KVM VPS\r\n- vDedicated Server\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo celebrate Singapore launch and oh and our 4th birthday (forgot to tell you, we are turning 4 in less than 10 days!), we have some exciting promotions for you: \r\n\r\n- **_HelloMerLion_**: 25% discount on our SG Servers + 25% Bandwidth Bump : Total usage: 25\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- **_IMissedOut_**: 15% discount on our SG Servers + 15%  Bandwidth Bump : Total Usage: 35\r\nEnd date: August 31st, Monday\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please note:** To redeem the bandwidth bump, which is a special for forum members only (Only the forums where we promote Nexus Bytes),  you must pm us (I.e me, uncle bobs only nephew).\r\n\r\nCoupons are valid for the following billing terms : \r\n-Quarterly\r\n-Semi-annual\r\n-Annual\r\n\r\n\r\n**Order Link:**\r\n\r\n**Premium KVM** : https://my.nexusbytes.com/cart.php?gid=26\r\n**vDedi**: https://my.nexusbytes.com/cart.php?gid=29\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n#### Why we think our newest location is awesome\r\n\r\n&gt;Singapore's name comes from 'Singa Pura' which means Lion City in Sanskrit. Once a British colonial trading post, today Singapore is a thriving global financial hub and described as one of Asia's economic \"tigers\". What do you know, Singapore is quite the \"beast\"!\r\n\r\n&gt;Singapore is a particularly well connected region, allowing local users to significantly reduce their latency time. If majority of user users are connecting from the asian region, spare them the stress and the anger, that is caused by slow loading websites. You can deploy your service in our Singapore Location today! *Don't keep the Merlion waiting*.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgflip.com/4blumc.jpg \"\")\r\n\r\n### Special Offer: Bob's Pizza Party\r\n\r\n&gt;Many of you may be familiar with Bob.
