All Topup orders placed before 2019-12-31 @ midnight are eligble for this deal.\r\n\r\n* No setup fee\r\n* No requirement to add additional year(s) to service(s) you already have.\r\n\r\nI'm in the christmas spirit and will keep the requirements to a minimum.  And I'll even throw in a step-by-\r\nstep guide \r\n\r\n* You have ordered a bundle previously.\r\n* You must add ALL missing locations. A bundle is a bundle ;)\r\n* Renewal date on new locations will be set to the same as your current bundle renewal date.\r\n* You must place the order BUT do NOT pay at this point!!!!\r\n* Open a ticket requesting a bundle topup and your order number\r\n* I will update the price on your order to **MATCH** your bundle order! \r\n* You pay the updated invoice and get fresh new idle servers \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Black Friday/Cyber monday deal was so popular, I've restocked Singapore, added  a sixth location to the Europe and USA bundles and opened this offer up again for an additional 20 orders.\r\n\r\nAll servers below are NAT IPv4 + IPv6 enabled.\r\n\r\nAll servers come with:\r\n\r\n* 1 vCPU (See FUP in terms)\r\n* 256 MB RAM\r\n* 5GB HDD\r\n* 500 GB BW\r\n\r\n\r\n**EUROPE**\r\n\r\n* Bulgaria\r\n* Norway\r\n* Germany\r\n* France\r\n* Italy\r\n* Romania\r\n\r\nThat is 6 VPS for just $18 in **TOTAL** for a whole YEAR!\r\nOrder Link: https://clients.mrvm.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;bid=17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**USA**\r\n\r\n* New York\r\n* West Virginia\r\n* Kansas City\r\n* Lenoir\r\n* Las Vegas\r\n* Seattle\r\n\r\nThat is 6 VPS for just $18 in **TOTAL **for a whole YEAR!\r\nOrder Link: https://clients.mrvm.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;bid=18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**ASIA Pacific**\r\n\r\n* Sydney\r\n* Perth\r\n* Singapore\r\n\r\nThat is 3 VPS for just $9 in **TOTAL** for a whole YEAR!\r\nOrder Link: https://clients.mrvm.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;bid=19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT:** Due to the ridiculously low pricing I am unable to entertain any change or variation under any circumstances, asking simply hurts my ability to be able to bring offers like this to the community. I appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should go without saying but just in case, these are none refundable.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\nAll locations have HAproxy front ends fully automated so you can host your site including https\r\nTun/TAP available\r\nFuse available\r\nNFS available\r\nAll IPv4 are NAT\r\nYou get 20 ports forwarded + 1 special port for ssh access over IPv4\r\n\r\nAll locations come with a routed IPv6 subnet\r\n\r\nYou will get access to the Virtualizor control panel for server management.\r\n\r\nBandwidth resets monthly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon uses are:\r\n\r\n* Teamspeak Servers\r\n* VPN Servers\r\n* Proxy Servers\r\n* Web Servers\r\n* Distributed database master&lt;&gt;master/slave setups\r\n* Scrapers\r\n* Cheap HA using Cloudflare and round-robin DNS\r\n* IRC clients (IPv6 only)\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple terms overview:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* No torrenting\r\n* NO TOR\r\n* TOR is not allowed!\r\n* No crypto mining/wallets\r\n* No bulk mailing\r\n* No IRC Servers\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
