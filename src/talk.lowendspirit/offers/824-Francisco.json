If you have services with them we can personally rack them for you.\r\n\r\nIf you're buying multiple nodes we can do any customizing you want (specific SSD's you want installed, etc) saving you on future remote hands. You'd just have to mail the drives to us in Vegas. We can also pre-badge &amp; pre-configure all IPMI's to your specifications.\r\n\r\nEDIT - You're my family and I love you but you're terrible. You're all terrible. Have a $10/each discount over what I'm giving on WHT.\r\n\r\nFrancisco"}
