I need it only one more day, or maybe two. \r\n\r\nPaid until February 25. Monthly billing from Hetzner is \u20ac 54.00 for the server + \u20ac 6.72 for the IPs = \u20ac 60.72 (plus VAT, if applicable). Setup fee if ordered directly from Hetzner is \u20ac 59.00, but there is no setup fee for transfers. \r\n\r\nThis AX51 a great server! I am sadly letting it go only because I got an AX101. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody here want it? If not I will put it up in the Hetzner Marketplace forum. If you want it, please post here or PM me your offer. \r\n\r\nBest wishes and kindest regards!  \ud83d\ude4f"}
