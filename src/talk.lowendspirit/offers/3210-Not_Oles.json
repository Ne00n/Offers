Shared unlimited access to all resources. At least processor cores could be dedicated if a neighbor uses [taskset](https://linuxhint.com/use-taskset-command/) or a similar tool.\r\n\r\nThis current setup means, for example, that a single neighbor could run more than one VPS using qemu, could use more than one IPv4, or could store terabytes of data files, etc. Currently there are two terrific neighbors, \ud83e\udd29 or three if we include me, @Not_Oles. \ud83e\udd14 Nobody is using significant resources -- thus, much remains available.\r\n\r\nNo GUI on the node yet. No web control panel yet. Just command line on the node for now. Of course, you can put whatever you want inside your VPS, and we also can add to the node. \r\n\r\nThe node has git, gcc, and many of their friends. \r\n\r\n**IPv4 Additional IP Connectivity Status**\r\n\r\nNeighbors currently using qemu have forwarded ports on the node IPv4 and qemu slirp user mode networking. You can see from the yabs that the [slirp speed seems okay.](https://talk.lowendspirit.com/discussion/comment/69084/#Comment_69084)  \r\n\r\nBoth IPv4 and IPv6 additional IPs worked fine on the node and inside VMs when the server was running Proxmox, so I imagine the current issue with the additional IPv4s not working in qemu has to do with my *clueless* configuration. \ud83d\ude35\r\n\r\nI have been reading documentation on qemu.org, on linux-kvm.org, and elsewhere. If I don't succeed in getting IPv4 additional IP connectivity working soon, I will post about it so you guys can pass me a clue. Meanwhile I am enjoying what I wanted, slowly \ud83d\udc22 learning a little of how the configuration works instead of having Proxmox do it for me. \r\n\r\nNobody has tried LXC yet. But I am sure we will get around to LXC before too long. \ud83d\udd1c\r\n\r\n**YABS**\r\n\r\nThe links below are to [yabs](https://yabs.sh) test results. Each result includes the single core Geekbench 5 performance scores listed here: \r\n\r\n * **Effect on bare metal of upgrade to sid:** [**1723 to 1745**](https://talk.lowendspirit.com/discussion/comment/68333/#Comment_68333)\r\n\r\n * **Qemu with and without -cpu host and -enable-kvm:** [**1524 vs 110**](https://talk.lowendspirit.com/discussion/comment/69084/#Comment_69084)\r\n\r\n**Pricing**\r\n\r\n * **Per neighbor:** $20.21 per month \r\n\r\n * When you think about the pricing, please consider that there are very few neighbors and Hetzner receives from me approximately $132.77 per month for the server and its IP addresses. The original pricing calculation is [here.](https://talk.lowendspirit.com/discussion/comment/56329/#Comment_56329) Please note that the currently offered unlimited unit size is not the originally calculated unit size.\r\n\r\n**How to Order**\r\n\r\n * Accounts may be requested by active members of the LES community and by others whose web presence or references are deemed by MetalVPS as sufficient.\r\n\r\n * To request an account, please post here, PM me, @Not_Oles, or use the email on my @Not_Oles LES profile. \r\n\r\n**When and How to Pay**\r\n\r\n * **No payment is due until after your account is set up and you are 100% satisfied.**\r\n\r\n * Payments available via Paypal or Stripe.\r\n\r\n**Warnings!** \r\n\r\n * RAID 0! [Fast 409.2K IOPS](https://talk.lowendspirit.com/discussion/comment/68332/#Comment_68332) but when one disk dies the data on both disks is lost! \ud83e\udd29\r\n\r\n * Node OS might suddenly change anytime soon! \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n * Hey! It's Debian **unstable!** \ud83e\udd29\r\n\r\n * Grumpy, ignorant, clueless, greedy administrator! \ud83d\ude00\r\n\r\n * Delivery might take awhile! \ud83d\ude34 \r\n\r\n * @Not_Oles frequently messes up new installs! \ud83d\ude31\r\n\r\n * **No warranty,** to the extent permitted by applicable law. No service level agreement. **Not for business use.** Intended especially for computer learning and fun! \r\n\r\n * @Not_Oles tries to keep the system updated. Frequent maintenance reboots are guaranteed, but uptime is pretty okay. Node load averages usually are pretty low. \r\n\r\n * Please make your own **redundant, offsite backups!** It's easy to download your backup to a safe place. Please also make sure that you actually can restore from your backups! Please think of your MetalVPS account as **ephemeral!**\r\n\r\n * @Not_Oles rents servers from Hetzner. MetalVPS.com is an indie project of Tom Miller, not an official Hetzner project, and not an official lowendspirit.com project.\r\n\r\n * Neighbors can see your account name, the processes you are running, and much other information. So, **please do not put confidential information on the server.** \r\n\r\n**What People are Saying**\r\n\r\n * **About MetalVPS**\r\n\r\n[\"Nice trial and results!
