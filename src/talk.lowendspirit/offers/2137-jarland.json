I'd like to save you from the sales pitch as nothing changed since then, but you can read it here: https://talk.lowendspirit.com/discussion/2038/mxroute-black-friday-2020-a-little-early\r\n\r\nFor the actual event of Black Friday I'm releasing a planned promotion:\r\n\r\n2GB Storage\r\n5 Domains\r\n25 Email Accounts\r\n25 Email Forwarders\r\n25 Domain Aliases\r\n300 outbound per hour (per email)\r\nOrder: https://portal.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=108\r\n\r\nThese tend to go faster than others, and only 300 will be sold. Two were sold early, immediately after I added stock, thanks to product ID guessers :)\r\n\r\nDon't create email accounts just to go over 300 per hour. The point of the per email limit isn't to make you jump through hoops, it's to stop you from a single activity that sends more than 300 per hour."}
