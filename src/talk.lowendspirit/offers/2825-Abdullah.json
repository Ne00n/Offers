Today, millions of refugees and displaced persons welcome a holy month in incredibly difficult circumstances, while struggling to put food on the tables for their families.\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and deteriorating economic situation globally has pushed many of those most vulnerable even deeper into extreme poverty. Many have reported having lost their informal daily wages, and now face severe levels of food insecurity. \r\n\r\n\r\nTaking the Ramazan spirit forward, we will be sponsoring meals and bakery products, for every webhosting plan purchased starting today 21st April till 11th May 2021. \r\nYou find a good home for your website, while helping them secure basic necessities food &amp; water.  :) \r\n100% of the proceeds will be donated to charity, i.e. your website is hosted free of charge.
