Public ones, however, are not.\r\nQ: What\u2019s your refund policy?\r\nWe do have a 30-day refund policy for your first service with us.\r\nQ: What payment methods are accepted?\r\nWe accept payments via PayPal.\r\nQ: Do you have a test IP/file?\r\nYes.\r\nQ: Do you offer instant setup?\r\nServers on this offer are instantly provisioned, subject to stock availability.\r\nQ: Why my order was marked as fraud?\r\nThe usual reason for an order, being marked as fraud is if you place it from a VPN/Server IP. We do not allow such kind of orders, so if you intend to order with a VPN, it will be marked as fraud. If you are on vacation/holiday and live in a different country, please contact us prior to ordering.\r\n\r\n**Network Info:**\r\nDallas, USA\r\nTest IPv4: 192.138.210.63\r\nTest IPv6: 2604:0880:0052:0000:0000:0000:01e5:657b\r\nTest file(IPv4): http://lg-dal.ipv4.drserver.net/100MB.test\r\nLooking glass(IPv4): http://lg-dal.ipv4.drserver.net/\r\nTest file(IPv6): http://lg-dal.ipv6.drserver.net/100MB.test\r\nLooking glass(IPv6): http://lg-dal.ipv6.drserver.net/\r\n\r\nAll network ports have DDoS protection.
