Since then, we\u2019ve gained over 405 customers, expanded into 8 total locations and grown as a company learning from hard mistakes and evolving our product line to what it is today.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate this 1st year trading as a company, here\u2019s a small promo to show my regards.\r\n\r\n**10GB Reseller Promotion - \u00a312.99/year**\r\n10GB NVMe/SSD Storage\r\n500GB Monthly Bandwidth \r\nUnlimited User Accounts\r\n\r\n**_This is 67.5% cheaper than our standard 10GB Reseller plan!

I redesigned those hosting plans to offer the lowest price possible. As a trade off for this, it means additional discounts on top of the already low price wouldn\u2019t be feasible. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[Make sure you tell your friends about SmallWeb and you can earn a 10% commission on each sale.](https://smallweb.net/order/affiliates/signup/ \"Make sure you tell your friends about SmallWeb and you can earn a 10% commission on each sale.\")\r\n\r\nPlease wait patiently for any orders you place to be manually processed.
