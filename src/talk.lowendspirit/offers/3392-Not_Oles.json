You can spin up an LXC container or a KVM. Reasonable access to all resources. No arbitrary limits.\r\n\r\nReasonable access without arbitrary limits means, for example, that a single neighbor could run more than one VPS, could use more than one IPv4 and IPv6, etc. \r\n\r\nCurrently there is one user plus @Not_Oles. \ud83e\udd29 So far, nobody has been using significant server resources -- thus, almost everything remains available.\r\n\r\n**YABS**\r\n\r\nPosted in comment below.\r\n\r\n**Pricing**\r\n\r\nPlease make an offer. \r\n\r\n**How to Order**\r\n\r\n * Accounts may be requested by active members of the LES community and by others whose web presence or references are deemed sufficient by MetalVPS.\r\n\r\n * To request an account, please post here, PM me, @Not_Oles, or use the email on my @Not_Oles LES profile. \r\n\r\n**When and How to Pay**\r\n\r\n * **No payment is due until after your account is set up and you are 100% satisfied.**\r\n\r\n * Payments available via Paypal or Stripe.\r\n\r\n**Warnings!** \r\n\r\n * Hey! It's Slackware-***current*** \ud83e\udd29\r\n\r\n * KVM and LXC are insufficiently tested on this machine. \ud83d\udd1c Want to help test?  \r\n\r\n * ~~Grumpy, ignorant,~~ clueless, ~~greedy~~ administrator! \ud83d\ude00 Except for *clueless\u2122* the remainder of this line is retired.\r\n\r\n * Sometimes trusted neighbors might get sudo. \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude4a Did you know that [sudo can be configured?](https://www.tecmint.com/sudoers-configurations-for-setting-sudo-in-linux/)\r\n\r\n * Delivery might take awhile! \ud83d\ude34 \r\n\r\n * @Not_Oles frequently messes up new installs! \ud83d\ude31\r\n\r\n * **No warranty,** to the extent permitted by applicable law. No service level agreement. **Not for business use.** Intended especially for computer learning and fun! \r\n\r\n * @Not_Oles tries to keep the system updated. Frequent maintenance reboots are guaranteed, but uptime is pretty okay. Node load averages usually are pretty low. \r\n\r\n * Please make your own **redundant, offsite backups!** It's easy to download or sync or clone your backup to a safe place. Please also make sure that you actually can restore from your backups! Please think of your MetalVPS account as **ephemeral!**\r\n\r\n * MetalVPS.com is an indie project of Tom Miller and not an official lowendspirit.com project.\r\n\r\n * Neighbors can see your account name, some of the processes you are running, and much other information.
