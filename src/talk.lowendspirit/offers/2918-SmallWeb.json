First and most importantly, the promotional code \"HALF\" for 50% off applicable plans has been increased to a maximum number of 99 uses, instead of being time based. That means at the time of this thread, there are 55 uses left. Take this as subtle symbolism that massive promotions are being wound down and will become rarer in the future. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we're trialing the DirectAdmin Pro Back beta release in our secondary Amsterdam server. We are planning to convert our infrastructure from CloudLinux to the Pro Pack in the future. You can find more about that on our blog. Current features include user resource throttling, automatic SSL certificates and application management through Nginx Unit. We've set resource limits similar to those used with CloudLinux: 20MB/s I/O and 50 \"tasks\" for our shared hosting plans. We're still looking to find the sweet spot.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we're now offering more billing periods for our shared hosting plans including our 1GB plan at only \u00a30.50p per month.\r\n\r\nSee our plans below!\r\n\r\n1GB - \u00a30.50/month or \u00a30.25 with code HALF.\r\nHost 10 Websites\r\nUnlimited SQL Databases\r\n1GB NVMe Storage\r\n250GB Monthly Transfer\r\nUnlimited Email Accounts\r\nSoftaculous Apps Installer\r\nFree Let's Encrypt SSL\r\nDirectAdmin Control Panel\r\nOpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\nIsolated SSH Access \u274c\r\n\r\n2GB - \u00a31.00/month or \u00a30.50 with code HALF.\r\nHost 20 Websites\r\nUnlimited SQL Databases\r\n2GB NVMe Storage\r\nUnmetered Monthly Transfer\r\nUnlimited Email Accounts\r\nSoftaculous Apps Installer\r\nFree Let's Encrypt SSL\r\nDirectAdmin Control Panel\r\nOpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\nIsolated SSH Access \u2705\r\n\r\n5GB - \u00a32.00/month or \u00a31.00 with code HALF.\r\nUnlimited Websites\r\nUnlimited SQL Databases\r\n5GB NVMe Storage\r\nUnmetered Monthly Transfer\r\nUnlimited Email Accounts\r\nSoftaculous Apps Installer\r\nFree Let's Encrypt SSL\r\nDirectAdmin Control Panel\r\nOpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\nIsolated SSH Access \u2705\r\n\r\n10GB - \u00a33.00/month or \u00a31.50 with code HALF.\r\nUnlimited Websites\r\nUnlimited SQL Databases\r\n10GB NVMe Storage\r\nUnmetered Monthly Transfer\r\nUnlimited Email Accounts\r\nSoftaculous Apps Installer\r\nFree Let's Encrypt SSL\r\nDirectAdmin Control Panel\r\nOpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\nIsolated SSH Access \u2705\r\n\r\nOrder form: https://portal.smallweb.net/order/main/index/shared\r\n\r\nQuestions?
