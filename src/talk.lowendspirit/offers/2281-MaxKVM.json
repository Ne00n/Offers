{"id": 2281, "date": "2020-12-18 22:10:45", "user": "MaxKVM", "post": "Hello LES!\r\n\r\nYou might be happy to hear (if you are one of the people who has requested this feature countless times) that **Internal Networking** has finally been deployed on our global \"cloud\" KVM infrastructure. The MaxKVM **Internal Network** is now online _wordwide_ and all KVMs are able to communicate over the private internal network in each individual datacenter (no matter the host node in the DC).\r\n\r\nSince the main internal network spans all datacenters in the USA, _all_ virtual machines in the Los Angeles, Dallas, and/or New York datacenters are able to communicate with each other using Internal IPs (though Amsterdam and Singapore internal networks are limited to their respective DCs).\r\n\r\nPlease feel welcome to ping/trace to and from Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York internal IPs using one of our Looking Glass pages:\r\n\r\n[http://lg.lax.maxkvm.net](http://lg.lax.maxkvm.net \"http://lg.lax.maxkvm.net\") | Internal Test IP: 172.16.0.10\r\n[http://lg.dfw.maxkvm.net](http://lg.dfw.maxkvm.net \"http://lg.dfw.maxkvm.net\") | Internal Test IP: 172.17.0.10\r\n[http://lg.nyc.maxkvm.net](http://lg.nyc.maxkvm.net \"http://lg.nyc.maxkvm.net\") | Internal Test IP: 172.18.0.10\r\n\r\nWhile you're there, try out the new \"screenshot\" and \"ttfb\" commands. These were useful for us to diagnose geographic network and other technical issues while we configured a new anycast HA cluster for [maxkvm.com](https://www.maxkvm.com \"maxkvm.com\"), so we thought these features might also be helpful to some of you.\r\n\r\n**Internal Networking is available to all current and new subscribers. Please open a ticket and we will configure your system(s) on the internal network ASAP!**\r\n\r\n_What new feature should we deploy next? Comment or send a PM_\r\n\r\nNow that all the boring info is out of the way, let's talk about ~~Rampart~~..\r\n\r\n#**HOLIDAY DISCOUNTS!**\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\"https://www.maxkvm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/maxxmas.png\"/&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom now until 1/1/21, we will have **new promotions every single day that activate automatically every 24 hours.** The promotion code is the date and you will need to search through different products with different billing cycles to find the daily discount. \r\n\r\nAs an example, today's promotional code is **12-18-2020** (for 30% off the SKVM-\\*\\* on \\*\\*\\* billing cycle) and tomorrow's code is **12-19-2020** (but you will need to find the discounted service.) The next day's code will be **12-20-2020**, and this will continue until the end of 1/1/21 (PST).\r\n\r\nSome of these offers are _massive_ recurring discounts and will be extremely limited. Good luck!\r\n\r\nWe also have 3 custom KVM plans (including a new 256M plan) to offer along with our existing lineup between now and 1/1/21:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**SKVM-256M**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1x CPU \r\n256MB ECC RAM\r\n7GB NVMe SSD RAID 10\r\n0.25TB Transfer @ 1Gbps\r\n1x IPv4 &amp; IPv6 /64\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n$1.50/mo or $18/yr - [Add to Cart](https://manage.maxkvm.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=16 \"Add to Cart\")\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n**SKVM-2G-2CPU**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n2x CPU \r\n2GB ECC RAM\r\n50GB NVMe SSD RAID 10\r\n2TB Transfer @ 1Gbps\r\n1x IPv4 &amp; IPv6 /64\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n$5/mo or $49/yr - [Add to Cart](https://manage.maxkvm.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=13 \"Add to Cart\")\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n**SKVM-4G-4CPU**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n4x CPU \r\n4GB ECC RAM\r\n75GB NVMe SSD RAID 10\r\n3TB Transfer @ 1Gbps\r\n1x IPv4 &amp; IPv6 /64\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n$7/mo or $69/yr - [Add to Cart](https://manage.maxkvm.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=14 \"Add to Cart\")\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**EDU50** and **ADD35** are still valid!

Please understand all the resources in these plans are **fair share** and although machines can always burst to use 100% of allocated resources, systems detected running with a constant 100% utilization of CPU, Disk I/O, and/or Network could be issued a power cycle, hard shutdown, and/or suspension with or without prior notice depending on the severity of abuse.
