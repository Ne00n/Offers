What do you guys think of this one? \r\n\r\n**Not_Oles' Cyber Weekend Dream Deal!**\r\n\r\n**Buy three months. When you renew for the second three month period, you pay only for two months. Thus, month number six is free.**\r\n\r\n**Fine print:** Not recurring. If you cancel during the first three months you are charged the per diem rate. If you cancel during the second three month period you are charged the full monthly per diem rate during months four and five. Thus, no refunds during month six.

Limited availability. Delivery might take awhile. GNU/Linux command line peeps encouraged. *BSD and Plan 9 users welcomed. Window$ users welcomed. Apple users welcomed too.
