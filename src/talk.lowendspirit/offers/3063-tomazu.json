Our US expansion has been delayed by the current hardware shortage and shipping delays and while I am still positive to get our first North American / US location live within a few days, the full rollout will happen only in Q3. From a software and bundle perspective nothing has changed, and we are looking at offering reseller packages with DirectAdmin and once all three main hubs (EU, APAC &amp; US) are active, we will activate internal networking and many other features like BGP- and anycast services.\r\n\r\n**About Webhosting24:**\r\nWebhosting24 has been offering web hosting and domain registration services since 2001 and is using NVMe to power a new range of high-performance VPS services.
