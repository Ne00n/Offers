After a whole bunch of updates for our conrol panel and finding a new team member, we think it is realistic to be able to rent out more servers at the best prices without compromising quality.\r\n\r\nI have been offering hosting services since 2013 and during this time I have done everything possible to solve problems as quickly as possible.\r\nChristmas Eve to the data centre because a PDU has failed? Getting up at 3 in the morning because a system has failed? Spending family celebrations on a laptop to help a customer?\r\nEverything has already happened. Everything quite normal for me!\r\n\r\nAt the Skylink data centre on the German/Dutch border, we have been operating our systems for more than 2 years on our own hardware and data centre independent IP addresses.\r\n\r\nWe have already prepared a number of offers for November, which we will adapt at irregular intervals.\r\nPermanently, until the end of November, the following offer is available:\r\n\r\n\r\n**BF Special small SSD Offer**\r\n    1 shared Xeon E5 Core\r\n    4 GB ECC Arbeitsspeicher\r\n    40 GB SSD Speicher\r\n    1 IPv4 inklusive\r\n\r\n_for 2,99 \u20ac / month or 29,99 \u20ac / year_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom now on our current offers can always be found here: \r\nhttps://kts24.com/special_offers\r\n"}
