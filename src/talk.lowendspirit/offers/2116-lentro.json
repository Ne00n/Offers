Might have some other locations for Black Friday, but don't bet on it. 10 limit. \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt; \r\nBuy:\r\nhttps://buy.isodme.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=53\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n$3.50/mo, $40/yr, or $115/3 yr\r\n- 1 vCPU (fair share)\r\n- 512 MB RAM\r\n- 1 TB\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nAddons: \r\nUp to 10 TB storage @ $3/mo/TB\r\n1 GB RAM for $0.50/mo\r\n2 vCPUs at $0.50/mo\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nMore Info:\r\n- KVM\r\n- Proxmox\r\n- Stripe/PayPal accepted\r\n- RAIDz1 (ZFS version of RAID 5), so use this for secondary cold backups, as having two disks fail is possible. Expect slow speeds, and you'll be pleasantly suprised\r\n- SSD read caching layer\r\n- Hammering the disk nonstop will lead to I/O limitations \r\n\r\n- Please don't just buy this and request a refund because you want to switch to another BF storage VPS deal, so no refunds\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nAbout ISODME: \r\n- We have provided web hosting for web design customers for 2+ years now\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nLet me know if you have any questions or need anything in the comments below.
