I cannot guarantee what node you will be placed on, while some flexibility can be extended where possible it should not be expected.\r\n2. 1 Node has an E3-1270v5 rather than v6 and another node has E-2276G if you specifically wanted the E3-1270v6 and you don't get it as the assignment is random your move request to an E3-1270v6 will be granted.\r\n3. Due to the nature and reason for this specific sale being a unique one it is not possible to convert existing orders into this deal however all efforts to allow this sort of thing in the future will be made.\r\n4. The refund policy for these is strictly 48 hours from the time of the order being placed not the standard 14 days.\r\n5. On this rare occasion you can stack the offers (London Only)  up to 8GB Ram total, CPU cores do not stack, IPv6 does not stack, open a ticket after purchase and **before** first OS installation to request this, requests for stacking after initial OS install will **not** be granted.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you ever wanted a custom plan for London now is the best time to ask :) if it can be done it will be done however to save some time, for these servers 2vCPU's is the maximum :)\r\n\r\nThis advert is not exclusive, please feel free to share it, it is being posted to LES first though  &lt;3 \r\n\r\nQuestions and comments are all very welcome!\r\n\r\nCheers everyone!\r\n\r\nAnt."}
