These are all limited time deals, please do not ask me to replicate them after this BF/CM season, despite typing this I know it will not matter much but if you are 'that guy' know that you are only 1 of 100 people asking so it is not a 1 time exception.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! They will not be refunded, credited or otherwise if you did not think first before you bought.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! Subscriptions are not available because people forget and double pay then want a refund.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! I know no one reads the terms but agrees anyway so here is a quick overview of the important stuff.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! CPU Abuse: 60+% of a core over 24 hours or 100% of a core for 1+ hour\r\n&gt;! Disk is a shared resource not dedicated to you, if your IOPS R+W requests p/s disrupts other customers or impacts their fair expectations of service you will be shut down as a rule please keep IOPS below 300p/s avg on regular services or 1000 p/s on SSD over 24 hours or 1500 p/s avg for 1 hour on regular services and 6000 avg over an hour on SSD services.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! Tor = instant termination, no warnings, no \"but i just\" not interested, tor = gone\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! Torrents = same as tor, even over VPN/Proxy etc.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! No crypto mining, wallets etc.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! This all sounds harsh but you would not believe the things people do, terms are only imposed when they need to be, generally as long as your not bothering anyone there is no problem.\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! Shutdowns of services are automated only when you exceed 300% of the AUP i.e. exceed CPU/IOPS limits for 300% of the allotted limit (when you don't monitor your own server)\r\n&gt;! \r\n&gt;! Hope that covers everything, nothing above that is not already made clear prior to payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
