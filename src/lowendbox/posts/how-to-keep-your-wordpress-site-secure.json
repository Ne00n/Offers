This is mostly because strong passwords are hard to type and to remember. However, nowadays, there are many password managers available, such as LastPass, that can store those strong passwords for you.</span></p><p><b>Keep your server updated.</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security of your WordPress can only be as good as the server it is hosted on.

Other than that, there are smaller updates, once or twice a month, that fixes bugs and defends against security threats.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should always keep your WordPress updated, in addition to any plugins that you use. You can check for updates from the WP-admin portal.</span></p><p><b>Secure your workstation</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security of your website could be compromised if your computer is vulnerable to malware. For example, your WordPress credentials could be stolen if your computer has been affected by a keylogger.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why you should always use anti-virus software on your computer. Moreover, it is also a good idea to keep your browser and operating system up to date.</span></p><p><b>Make a backup of your WordPress</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you follow all the steps above to tighten your WordPress website\u2019s security, you should still take regular backups.
