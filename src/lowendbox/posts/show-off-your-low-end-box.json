Meanwhile, feel free to occupy yourself here and at the new domain of my Low End Box forums \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/\"><b>Low End Talk</b></a>. It is running a current version of bbPress and is hosted on the same <a href=\"http://www.quickweb.co.nz/\">QuickWeb</a> VPS as this blog. Feel free to continue the discussion there :)</p><p>And here is a question that I am thinking of throwing here for a while. I have been collecting and tracking hosting companies that provide \u201ccheap roots\u201d below a price point. We are getting providers from all over the place \u2014 some good, some bad. Some are still going, some have raised price, and some have since fallen into the <a href=\"/category/deadpool/\">dead pool</a>. So next time when I have a small project that requires a new low end box \u2014 which provider from the ever growing list should I choose?</p><p>Here is an idea. Maybe we should have a list of \u201cprojects\u201d \u2014 web sites, online stores, blogs, whatever that are actually hosted on low end providers, what their statistics is (amount of traffic, how busy the sites are, so no just-another-personal blog should apply), who they are currently hosting with and how long have they been with this low end provider.
