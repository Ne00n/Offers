I mean, it\u2019s not that webserver is down, but <b>both</b> DNS for the domain are off-line so not even the IP address can be resolved.</p><p>For example,</p><ul><li>AMHNetwork.com.au not resolvable (9 Nov)</li><li>CubicHost.org not resolvable (8 Nov, and is still offline)</li><li>2Host.com not resolvable (7 Nov)</li><li>NetSpaceLtd.com not resolvable (7 Nov)</li><li>ServerDeals.org not resolvable (6 Nov)</li><li>\u2026</li></ul><p>Everyday there are providers down for a brief period of time. WTF? I am talking about hosting providers\u2019 domains, i.e. the ones that provide you servers, network and all that. What are they thinking by putting <em>both</em> of their name servers on the same box, when they are supposed to provide redundancy?! When your webserver is down but A/MX records are still resolvable, then I guess there are still hope. When even ns(1|2).yourdomain.com are unresolvable \u2014 it\u2019s as good as dead.</p><p>Well. Next time when I see a provider putting both NS on the same box I\u2019ll voice it, as it shows their incompetency.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flow-end-providers-please-keep-your-dns-up%2F&amp;t=Low%20End%20Providers%20-%20Please%20Keep%20Your%20DNS%20Up%21\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Low%20End%20Providers%20-%20Please%20Keep%20Your%20DNS%20Up%21&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flow-end-providers-please-keep-your-dns-up%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flow-end-providers-please-keep-your-dns-up%2F&amp;title=Low%20End%20Providers%20-%20Please%20Keep%20Your%20DNS%20Up%21&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
