It seems to be a really busy month with new\u2019ish players dying left and right.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/revps.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/media/images/revps.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" alt=\"ReVPS\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> ReVPS</h3><p><a href=\"/tag/revps.com/\"><b>ReVPS</b></a> came into scene in early January, when the domain was first registered. It was selling 256MB OpenVZ VPS for $5/month. The IP still resolves to somewhere in HostNOC. Still pings, but port 80/443 fails to connect since May 7. If you actually checked the <a href=\"/blog/revps-5-256mb-openvz-vps/\">original post</a>, their entire website spelt <em>dodgy</em>, with mis-spellings and very bad geography knowledge. Another BurstNet reseller that we probably do not need.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/fierceservers.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/media/images/fierceservers.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"185\" alt=\"FierceServers\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> FierceServers</h3><p><a href=\"/tag/fierceservers.com/\"><b>FierceServers</b></a> was first reported here back in February 2010, sitting on a relatively new domain (registered in November 2009). Their doamin stopped resolving on 10 May, and I guess their servers are probably <em>too fierce</em> and burnt all their customers\u2019 virtual server as well. <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=948331\">Here is one relevant discussion thread on WHT</a>. Do note that they have <em>domain privacy</em> on their domain. WHOIS privacy something that is okay for small blog sites like this. However if you are a business dealing with clients on the Internet, it would be a big dodgy sign IMHO.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/thevpsnode.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/media/images/thevpsnode.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" alt=\"TheVPSNode\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> TheVPSNode</h3><p><a href=\"/tag/thevpsnode.com/\"><b>TheVPSNode</b></a> came into scene back in March 2010, and they are reselling BurstNet\u2019s OpenVZ offerings like many low end budget providers. They were doing it at the same price as BurstNet, and that does not seem to help bootstraping their business, especially after <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=932976\">this scamming fiasco surfaced</a>. The website thus has never been fully setup \u2014 nor were client\u2019s VPS I guess. The <a href=\"http://www.search.asic.gov.au/cgi-bin/gns030c?acn=140361404&amp;juris=9&amp;hdtext=ACN&amp;srchsrc=1\">company still appears to be registered</a> so maybe it will comeback one day. Maybe not.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/onenetwork.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/media/images/onenetwork.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" alt=\"OneNetwork\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> OneNetwork</h3><p><a href=\"/tag/onenetwork.net/\"><b>OneNetwork</b></a> got featured on LowEndBox again in late March 2010 \u2014 looks like we have more and more \u201cvery short lifespan\u201d hosting providers recently (although some people would prefer to call them scammers). It lived on a 13 year old domain \u2014 but then the age of domain does not really tell you about the history of the current registrant. There were DNS issues with domain, so on 28 April it decided to not resolve at all. The website did come back on 8 May, showing that it is <em>currently out of business</em>. Did people actually have a business plan when they start?</p><h3>Linux Managed</h3><p><a href=\"/tag/linuxmanaged.com/\"><b>LinuxManaged.com</b></a> gotta be one of the biggest joke \u2014 asking/advertising for pre-order of their VPS products when their website was in development. At the same time emailing me multiple times to have the site featured on LowEndBox, and then sockpuppeting on WHT with fake recommendations.</p><p>I guess no one is surprised by the out come. Their website was NEVER finished, and the domain is currently not resolving. The IP address is still live so I tried to connect to it, and the browser brought back <a href=\"http://royalehost.com/\">RoyaleHost.com</a> on the same IP. Maybe there is a part 2 in this story?</p><p>That\u2019s it for this month! There are some other providers that look <em>half-dead</em> which may appear in next month\u2019s dead pool.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/tag/hostmist.com/\">HostMist</a> \u2014 Showing emergency page since May 24.
