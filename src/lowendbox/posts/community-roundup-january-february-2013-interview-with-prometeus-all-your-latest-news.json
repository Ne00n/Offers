When a check fails, Zs1.org will check again every 1500 ms for 8 times. Basically, if a few packets fail from this side, the host will not show up as down.

More interviews, with better questions, are on the way!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&nbsp;7 Question Interview:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Q1. Prometeus were founded in 1997, way before hosting providers were selling virtualised servers. Can you tell us more about Prometeus and why it was founded?</em></p></blockquote><p>In the beginning of 1997 Daniela [his wife] was working as leader of the supportdesk for a software company, asthma forced her to leave (after being in hospital), since it was a closed place with several smokers. So we decided to start realizing small web sites for the local companies which at the time had no internet presence at all (and most not ever known internet). I was in need for a place to host the sites and noticed that there weren\u2019t so many hosting company. We started reselling some packages and two months later I rented the first server (Irix) :-)</p><blockquote><p><em>Q2. What has been the biggest change in the hosting industry since you began?</em></p></blockquote><p>Control Panels and the \u201cUnlimited\u201d wave. Panels (ensim, cpanel, plesk, etc) made it simple for everyone to \u201cbecome\u201d hosting provider, while I had to develop for years my tools and it was not easy. Unlimited, well did unlimited damages to the industry :-)</p><blockquote><p><em>Q3. Italy is by no means small. Why is it that there are very few Italian vps companies compared to similar sized countries such as the UK?</em></p></blockquote><p>Most Italian companies works for the domestic market only, so there is little chance they are know abroad. Also the service itself (VPS) is not very common, as it require some skills so often some advanced hosting hide or include a vps service. Then some years ago companies started selling the \u201ccloud\u201d (in most cases simple vps), which was a cool marketing term, so the term vps was almost skipped here :-)</p><blockquote><p><em>Q4. From backup servers to KVM servers, you guys offer a lot of choice! What has made you guys so successful?</em></p></blockquote><p>Choice, a good service and a decent price I suppose.</p><blockquote><p><em>Q5. What impact has LowEndBox had on your business?</em></p></blockquote><p>When we were listed the first time I was worried to not be able to sustain the flow of orders, reading other\u2019s experiences. It was a&nbsp;small delusion, orders were way below the expectations :P Then I saw the effect of the listing later, the exposures increased the users landing on our site and it was good.</p><p>In the end I think it is very important for us to be listed regularly, even when we don\u2019t are able to submit the right offer (such as the last one that was a big fiasco :-D ), as it help the brand visibility and is an occasion for people to appreciate (or criticize) our services in the blog comments. You guys do a great job for both users and providers.</p><blockquote><p><em>Q6. One big question most of your customers seem to want to know is: will you be expanding abroad?</em></p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t know, really. From a business point of view I know it will help, but personally when I had servers in US (or NL, DE) I often felt important. Maybe if I find the right datacenter\u2026 ;-)</p><blockquote><p><em>Q7. What can we expect to see from Prometeus in 2013?</em></p></blockquote><p>The damn Cloud done right! :-)</p><hr><p><strong>Thank you for reading.
