I guess it is still better to be late than never. So here is a list of previously featured providers that become <em>no more</em> sometime last month in June 2010.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/gretzkyhosting.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/gretzkyhosting.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" alt=\"GretzyHosting\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> GretzkyHosting</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Domain Parked</p><p><a href=\"/tag/gretzkyhosting.com/\"><b>GretzkyHosting</b></a> has first graced LowEndBox back in 2008, offering $6.95/month OpenVZ VPS with merely 96MB of memory. While I have not been tracking this particular host, it stopped resolving on 1st of June. It did come back a few days later, only to go down again on 26 June 2010 \u2014 this time it came back up on a Google AdSense for Domain page. I guess we have to declare it <b>dead</b>. I guess Snat is going back to write his blog rather than doing hard laboring job of running a low end virtual server company.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/junaweb.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/junaweb.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" alt=\"JunaWeb\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> JunaWeb</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Redirect to HeHost.com</p><p>Now something more recent. <a href=\"/tag/junaweb.com/\"><b>JunaWeb</b></a> only scored one post here as well back in March this year, for their $7/month 128MB OpenVZ VPS. The offer was a St. Patrick\u2019s Day special and did not really last \u2014 nor has the provider itself I guess. Now when you navigate to JunaWeb it redirects to HeHost. HeHost\u2019s VPS starts at $49.95 \u2014 definitely not the low end with the definition around here.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/breezehost.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/breezehost.jpg\" alt=\"BreezeHost\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> BreezeHost</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Redirect to InoxHost.co.uk</p><p><a href=\"/tag/breezehost.net/\"><b>BreezeHost</b></a> was also first reviewed in March on their sub-$3 OpenVZ plan with 256MB of guaranteed memory. The plan is \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d, and indeed it was! With over 30 comments on the blog post and most of them are against the provider. On 25 June the domain stopped to resolve, and on 4 July the domain came back, only with excuses blaming on their payment provider. It started with SoloManaged/LinuxManaged.com, and it ended up in the same pit. Clients are transferred to InoxHost.co.uk, which is a lot more expensive.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/cohoster.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/cohoster.jpg\" alt=\"Cohoster\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> Cohoster</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Website offline</p><p><a href=\"/tag/cohoster.net/\"><b>Cohoster</b></a> was only reported on 14 June 2010, and on 17<sup>th</sup> the website went down. Came back up for a small period of time on 21<sup>st</sup>, and have been offline ever since. Maybe $6.40 VMWare packages are just unrealistic? I certainly am keeping eyes on other <a href=\"/tag/vmware/\">VMWare based providers</a> if it is the case. Either way, a total FAIL.</p><h3>TheVPSGods.com</h3><p>I have actually never posted their offers on LowEndBox. When I first saw their offers on WHT back in early May, these were too good to be true. However the way they spammed WHT looks quite suss so I only added them to my tracker, but never bothered to re-post their offers here. The owner is also associated with DareDevilHosting, who was <a href=\"/blog/lowendbox-dead-pool-april-2010/\">in our dead pool 2 months ago</a>. It turns out only after 1 month the domain stopped resolving on 8 June. Multiple FAIL!</p><p>I think that\u2019s it for the month. The \u201ccandidate\u201d from last month, HostMist, did manage to resurrect itself + giving an <a href=\"/blog/hostmist-5-10-128mb-openvz-vps-exclusive-offer/\">exclusive offer</a> to the LEB readers. Good on them! <a href=\"/tag/highvps.com/\">HighVPS</a> has also been sold, but their website is still functioning and looks like you can still buy the same packages.</p><p>I also noticed that two providers have their websites parked over the last couple of days \u2014 <a href=\"/tag/zabogo.com/\">Zabogo</a> and <a href=\"/tag/vpsrepublic.com/\">VPSRepublic</a>. Weird. One was backed by Graxis and the other one backed by EchoServers. We\u2019ll see next month.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fdead-pool-june-2010%2F&amp;t=Dead%20Pool%20June%202010\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dead%20Pool%20June%202010&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fdead-pool-june-2010%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fdead-pool-june-2010%2F&amp;title=Dead%20Pool%20June%202010&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/breezehost-5-97-384mb-openvz-vps-in-chicago-or-netherlands/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
