But if you are a first-timer and you have never used a VPS before, you may be quite lost once you\u2019re on your server. In this tutorial, I want to show you some basic commands for moving around your first ever (Linux-based) VPS.</p><p>I am going to assume a Debian-based distribution in my examples. I\u2019m using Ubuntu 14.04 more specifically. Most commands should work on any Linux distribution; the only distribution-specific commands are those for the package manager.</p><p>Ready? Set? Let\u2019s go!</p><p><span id=\"more-5661\"></span></p><h2>ls</h2><p>The first command I want you to know about is \u2018ls\u2019. \u2018ls\u2019 is used to list directory contents, so it lists the files and directories contained in the the directory you currently are in. When you log in via SSH, you end up in your username\u2019s home directory. In case of root, this is /root. In case of a regular user, it is usually /home/{username}. To use \u2018ls\u2019 just type:</p><blockquote><p>ls</p></blockquote><p>In the terminal and you should get a list of files and directories contained in the current directory.</p><p>\u2018ls\u2019 has three options/arguments that are most commonly used: \u2018-l\u2019, \u2018-a\u2019, and a path name. I\u2019ll briefly go over all three of them:</p><ul><li>If you pass \u2018-a\u2019 to \u2018ls\u2019 you get the following command: \u2018ls -a\u2019. This ensures that hidden files and directories (whose name starts with a dot . ) are also shown.</li><li>If you pass \u2018-l\u2019 to \u2018ls\u2019 you get the following command: \u2018ls -l\u2019. This shows the results as a list with more details, rather than a columned view.</li><li>If you pass a path (like /var/www) to \u2018ls\u2019, you get to see the contents of that directory. For example, \u2018ls /var/www\u2019 shows you the contents of the directory /var/www. This also works individual files.</li></ul><p>You can combine options starting with a minus \u2018-\u2018 by stacking the characters. So \u2018ls -a\u2019 and \u2018ls -l\u2019 combined would become \u2018ls -al\u2019 and it will both show hidden files and directories <em>and</em> show them as a list.</p><h2>&nbsp;cd</h2><p>The \u2018cd\u2019 command helps you move around. By typing \u2018cd\u2019 followed by a path, you change the current directory to that path. For example, if you want to go to /var/www, you would type:</p><blockquote><p>cd /var/www</p></blockquote><p>Typing \u2018cd\u2019 without any arguments returns you to your username\u2019s home directory.</p><h2>Tab completion</h2><p>When typing commands, arguments, or path names, you can often tap the tab key to get the command or path completed. When there is more than one option, your shell shows a list of options available. The only way to really get the hang of this is by trying it out.</p><h2>nano</h2><p>Nano is a tool for viewing and editing text files; it does not work with binary files like images or zip files. When you want to open a file, say /etc/apt.sources.list, you type the following command:</p><blockquote><p>nano /etc/apt.sources.list</p></blockquote><p>This opens the nano editor where you can freely move around using the arrow keys and type wherever you want.</p><p>Nano offers various options on the bottom of the screen. All options start with a ^, which means you should use the CTRL key combined with the letter that follows. For example:</p><ul><li>To save a file, press CTRL+O and press enter after having filled out the correct file name. When editing a file, the file name is often filled out for you and you only need to press enter.</li><li>To exit, press CTRL+X.</li></ul><p>Most options also have explanations written besides them and there\u2019s even a help option.</p><h2>Getting help</h2><p>If you need to know the arguments available for a certain command, you can type the command followed by \u2018\u2013help\u2019. For example, to get the available options for \u2018cd\u2019, you type:</p><blockquote><p>cd \u2013help</p></blockquote><p>Notice the space in between.</p><h2>apt</h2><p>This is the one command that\u2019s specific to Debian-based distributions. \u2018apt\u2019 is a package management tool and it a stripped down version of \u2018aptitude\u2019, which is the full tool.</p><p>To install a package with apt, you have to know the package name. Most packages names are straight-forward, like \u2018apache2\u2019 for Apache 2 and \u2018nginx\u2019 for NGINX. If you do not know the package name, use \u2018apt search {package name}\u2019 to search available packages and their descriptions.</p><p>Once you know a package name, use \u2018apt install\u2019 to install a package. For example, to install Apache2:</p><blockquote><p>apt install apache2</p></blockquote><p>Depending on whether you are logged in as root or a sudo user, you may have to prefix the command with \u2018sudo\u2019 (\u2018sudo apt install apache2\u2019). <a title=\"Securing your server: SSH and sudo\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/securing-your-server-ssh-and-sudo/\">Read more about sudo here</a>.</p><h2>Final notes</h2><p>That\u2019s it for this part of the tutorial. You now know some basic commands to find you way around a linux server. There\u2019s plenty of more commands to learn, including some essential which you would use quite often. Those are, however, for next week!</p><p>Key in learning to work with Linux is working with it a lot. Safest thing to do it getting a test server which you can reinstall in case something goes wrong. Such a server can be used as a perfect testing area and you can safely try out any command you like.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbasic-linux-commands-vps-tutorial-i%2F&amp;t=Finding%20your%20way%20on%20your%20first%20ever%20VPS%20-%20Part%20I\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Finding%20your%20way%20on%20your%20first%20ever%20VPS%20-%20Part%20I&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbasic-linux-commands-vps-tutorial-i%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbasic-linux-commands-vps-tutorial-i%2F&amp;title=Finding%20your%20way%20on%20your%20first%20ever%20VPS%20-%20Part%20I&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/centos-6-end-of-life-is-coming-upgrade-to-a-new-centos-7-vps-now/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"CentOS 6 End of Life is Coming!
