As part of this effort we have recently found a plugin that brings back the functionality to subscribe to e-mail notifications for comments on a topic, or for replies to one of your comments. This allows you to stay up-to-date on offers or tutorials that you like by getting notified when a comment is posted.</p><p>We\u2019re also going to do some other things differently about which I\u2019d like to tell you more!</p><p><span id=\"more-7880\"></span></p><p><strong>Offer categories</strong></p><p>Starting with the next offer post going live, we\u2019re going to introduce four categories into which we will group offers. This will give you some sort of guidance or overview of what kind of offer is being posted and what to expect. These are the categories we\u2019re going to start with:</p><ul><li>\u201cNew Provider!\u201d \u2013 Providers that are featured for the first time.</li><li>\u201cExotic Location\u201d \u2013 Alaska, Antarctica, or Santa Town.</li><li>\u201cResident Host\u201d \u2013 Providers that have been around for a while, are registered businesses or at least have a face linked to them.</li><li>\u201cVauxhall Vectra Host\u201d \u2013 The ones with a bit of an iffy reputation. They still get you there and offer a service, but there may be some bumps along the road and they\u2019re not made for a grand prix!</li></ul><p>We hope that this adds a different dimension to the site and we\u2019re looking forwards to receiving your feedback on this!</p><p><strong>Offer contents</strong></p><p>For years now, offer posts have been mostly listing information either sent to us or found on the internet. While there is some added value in that, as not all information is available publicly, it\u2019s not really helpful to our visitors. Therefore we\u2019re going to focus more on making offer posts a bit of a review at the same time. What do we notice about an offer? Is something off based on the offer, the host\u2019s website, or anything else? Did something happen with a provider recently you need to be aware of? Is what a provider is saying or offering making sense? What were the comments on the last post like?</p><p>We hope that by doing this we\u2019ll give our visitors a bit of insight into what to pay attention to when buying and make them aware of the ups and downs of providers/offers.</p><p><strong>More tutorials</strong></p><p>ColoCrossing has asked a writer they have hired for their own (corporate) blog to also write tutorials for LowEndBox. You should see these appearing about once a week on a variety of topics.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fchanges-are-coming-to-lowendbox%2F&amp;t=Changes%20%28are%20coming%29%20to%20LowEndBox\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Changes%20%28are%20coming%29%20to%20LowEndBox&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fchanges-are-coming-to-lowendbox%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fchanges-are-coming-to-lowendbox%2F&amp;title=Changes%20%28are%20coming%29%20to%20LowEndBox&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/looking-for-community-industry-news/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Interesting Community News on LowEndBox\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Interesting-Industry-News-LEB-150x150.jpg) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Looking for Community &amp; Industry News!</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/call-for-community-news/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Call for community news\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/leb-centered-small.jpg) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Call for community news</div></div></a></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/mpkossen/\" title=\"All posts by Maarten Kossen\" rel=\"author\">Maarten Kossen</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">Maarten Kossen was the administrator of LowEndBox from 2013 to 2015, and brought many ideas and improvements to the website during his leadership.
