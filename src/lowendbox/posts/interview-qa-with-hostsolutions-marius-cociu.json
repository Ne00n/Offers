It\u2019d be a rare LET member who hasn\u2019t had a HostSolutions VPS at some point.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this interview we hear from Marius (@cociu), <a href=\"https://hostsolutions.ro/\">HostSolutions</a>\u2018 founder about his experience in hosting, how he sees the world, and how to make your marriage work.</p><p><strong>Q: Where in the world do you live?</strong><br>\nA: I live normally where I like.&nbsp; For the moment I am in Romania and I like it.</p><p><strong>Q: Tell me about your background and your company\u2019s history</strong><br>\nA: This company was born after some bad experience with some local hosting company.&nbsp; We sell perfumes and in a Black Friday when we have been prepared all year to sell in good prices some top perfumes our competitors was flooding us and I decide to invent in my own DC. In the company there are a total of 8 persons right now and we plan to get 4 more in the near future. I like to call my company a very small one but with huge grow every year which is good.</p><p><span id=\"more-24110\"></span></p><p><strong>Q: I remember when you got married and you posted pictures of you and your bridge on LET. How is married life? It looked like Romanian weddings are very big!</strong><br>\nA: Pffff , difficult to respond to you!&nbsp; (I am married for the second time married.&nbsp; The need much tolerance this is the secret).&nbsp; First, fuck you because maybe my wife will see the answer.&nbsp; So how is \u201cmarried\u201d ? \u2026.. For sure every person need his own family.&nbsp; It is a good life \u2026 but man \u2026 \u201cless sisters\u201d . All others aspects are perfect.&nbsp; I have my own little girl and is a different sentiment, so yes i strongly recommend to all MAKE CHILDREN WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG NOT LIKE ME !!! Don\u2019t get me wrong but if i will have 3rd marriage I will come again with some pictures. And yes normally in Romania have big weddings (not my case because i have invited only very appropriate people to me ).</p><p><strong>Q: What would you tell someone looking to start a hosting company today? What advice would you offer?<br>\n</strong>A: Like any other business in the first year is very difficult, so I suggest hard work, patience, and be a true person.&nbsp; This will create for you a way to make profit in the future.</p><p><strong>Q: Where do you think the future takes the hosting industry?<br>\n</strong>A: I think this way how is today will disappear very soon.&nbsp; 2-3 big companies like A players will remain and nothing more. I mean in the near future you cannot sell only an unmanaged service and stop it there. The clients is changing and is became lazy \u2026 so i you want to survive you will need to differentiate and offer any kind of platforms including applications to be more easy to the final client.</p><p><strong>Q: What makes your company unique in today\u2019s evolving market landscape? How are you evolving with the times? How has your technology changed over the years?<br>\n</strong>A: What make my company unique ?&nbsp; Simple..I am like others but all what we have here was constructed&nbsp; from zero , so every guy knows every cable from the DC.&nbsp; We know what we have in the background . Also my city is unique.&nbsp; Top 3 in traffic consumption in Romania. I own the building and I own the hardware. No credits, no shit.&nbsp; Also we have our own fiber in Oradea which is around 475 km all underground.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your role? What do you find most difficult?<br>\n</strong>A: Good question.&nbsp; Here we are a family, so no boss role, no fucking shit.&nbsp; When we are in problems all my employers work 7/24 including \u201cthe boss\u201d.&nbsp; When we are free we make barbecue here so the most difficult will be the day when will this must to stop and close the doors.&nbsp; We are really a big family here and will be very difficult to tell someone i cannot afford to pay you anymore.</p><p><strong>Q: Both personally and professionally, what guiding principles ground you?</strong><br>\nA: I am a very transparent person.</p><p><strong>Q: Give us some details on new and exciting things you are working on<br>\n</strong>A: I am investing much to change hostsolutions.ro reputation from what it was in the last 2 years.</p><p><strong>Q: Why should customers trust you and your business?</strong><br>\nA: Because we are a very transparent company..a small one with hard workers .</p><p><strong>Q: Final thoughts and anything you would like to add?</strong><br>\nA: I really missing some people from LET \u2013 older users so for some reason this people was quit because something was changed \u2026 maybe someone can take a look back and see the real reason. Btw glad to see you survive.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-hostsolutions-marius-cociu%2F&amp;t=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20HostSolutions%27%20Marius%20%28%40cociu%29\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20HostSolutions%27%20Marius%20%28%40cociu%29&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-hostsolutions-marius-cociu%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-hostsolutions-marius-cociu%2F&amp;title=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20HostSolutions%27%20Marius%20%28%40cociu%29&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
