RHEL is Red Hat\u2019s premium enterprise Linux operating system, which emphasizes production-grade stability. For many years, the CentOS project took the same sources and patches that made up RHEL and recompiled them into CentOS, which was freely available. Thus you could obtain the same binaries that were used for RHEL for free. This was completely legal under the licenses used by RHEL (predominantly the GNU Public License). Many users appreciated the ability to \u201cget RHEL for free\u201d and benefit from Red Hat\u2019s development work in bringing a very stable, well-tested Linux OS to the market.</p><p>In January 2014, CentOS announced it was joining Red Hat. In July of 2019, IBM acquired Red Hat.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s changed?</strong></p><p>Previously, CentOS was downstream of Red Hat. CentOS announced recently they are moving to a position upstream of Red Hat and will now serve as a development test bed for RHEL. It will now be called \u201cCentOS Stream\u201d.</p><p>Additionally, CentOS\u2019s 5-year long-term support timeframe was cut to 2 years. This changes CentOS 8\u2019s EOL to 2021.</p><p><strong>What is the impact?</strong></p><p>For many users, this dramatically changes the value proposition offered by CentOS. Prior to this change, CentOS was regarded as being as good as RHEL, since it was the same binaries (in fact, the only difference was the name and trademarked art). Even shops that paid for RHEL for their production nodes would often use CentOS for their development systems.</p><p>Now, CentOS will be a different animal than RHEL entirely. Just because something works on RHEL no longer means it will also work on CentOS.</p><p>The change of EOL was also highly significant. Part of the RHEL/CentOS value was that you could deploy it and receive security patches for up to 5 years without having to upgrade the OS. Patching for security is usually trivial while upgrading major releases is not.</p><p>As an example consider Dreamhost, which used Debian for years on their thousands of servers. They <a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/change-is-in-the-air-dreamhost-upgrades/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">switched to Ubuntu</a> solely so they would not have to upgrade as frequently.&nbsp; &nbsp;Companies with high uptime requirements and many systems often prize long maintenance lifecycles.</p><p>Probably those suffering the most are users who just upgraded to CentOS 8, thinking they had years of support left. Easy for them to feel the rug has been yanked out from under them.</p><p>Ironically, CentOS 7 will be supported until 2024 \u2013 three years after CentOS 8 is no longer supported.</p><p><strong>Why was this change made?</strong></p><p>I guess it depends on your perspective.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">If you\u2019re RedHat</a>, it \u201cprovides a platform for rapid innovation at the community level but with a stable enough base to understand production dynamics. These changes and feedback can more quickly be channeled into productization, resulting in Linux platforms that meet the needs of an incredibly varied user base.\u201d</p><p>If you\u2019re more cynical, you might surmise that IBM \u2013 which paid $34 billion for RedHat \u2013 sees CentOS as a threat to RHEL sales. By changing the product into something that is markedly different from RHEL, they force users to choose between using non-RHEL or paying for RHEL.</p><p><strong>Wait, isn\u2019t Fedora a testbed for RHEL? How is CentOS Stream different?</strong></p><p>It does seem confusing. Most likely, Fedora is \u201cbleeding edge,\u201d CentOS Stream will be \u201ccloser to polished\u201d, and RHEL will continue to be \u201cwell-tested\u201d but time will tell.</p><p><strong>I hate this change!</strong></p><p>You can certainly <a href=\"http://chng.it/KCwPS2rH8F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign a petition</a> to try and change IBM\u2019s mind. But it\u2019s their software and they can do what they want with it.</p><p><strong>Is there any hope for going back to the way things were?</strong></p><p>Probably not with CentOS but if you mean \u201cRHEL for free,\u201d then yes. There are three options to consider:</p><ul><li>One of the CentOS founders has launched <a href=\"https://rockylinux.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rocky Linux</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.cloudlinux.com/announcing-open-sourced-community-driven-rhel-fork-by-cloudlinux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CloudLinux announced</a> they\u2019ll be recreating CentOS</li><li>There\u2019s always Oracle Linux. They released a cheeky website called <a href=\"https://centos.rip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">centos.rip</a></li></ul><p>Of course, there are other quality Linux distros, including Debian and Ubuntu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/resetting-that-linux-root-password-you-forgot/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"lowendtutorial\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lowendtutorial-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Resetting that Linux Root Password You Forgot</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/nginx-vs-openlitespeed-vs-apache/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Nginx vs. OpenLiteSpeed vs. Apache\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nginx-vs-openlitespeed-vs-apache-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Nginx vs. OpenLiteSpeed vs. Apache</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/top-ten-things-that-should-be-in-your-dot-files/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Top Ten Things That Should Be In Your Dot Files\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lowendtutorial-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Top Ten Things That Should Be In Your Dot Files</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/visualwebtechnologies-wide-range-of-cloudlinux-backed-cpanel-offers-in-virginia/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"VisualWebTechnologies: Wide Range of Cloudlinux-backed cPanel Offers in Virginia\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/visualwebtechnologies-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">VisualWebTechnologies: Wide Range of Cloudlinux-backed cPanel Offers in Virginia</div></div></a></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/raindog308/\" title=\"All posts by raindog308\" rel=\"author\">raindog308</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/raindog308\" class=\"bio-icon bio-icon-website\"></a><p class=\"bio-description\">I'm Andrew, techno polymath and long-time LowEndTalk community Moderator.
