Over the past two months or so, I have seen several hosts deadpool where they would have been saved by another company in the period before. So, it\u2019s time for my first ever deadpool post!</p><hr><p><strong><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tactical-VPS-2014-01-28-09-06-12-300x181.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tactical-VPS-2014-01-28-09-06-12-300x181.png.webp\" alt=\"TacticalVPS\" width=\"300\" height=\"181\" data-was-processed=\"true\">TacticalVPS</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Status:</span> Server not found/website offline/nodes offline</p><p>TacticalVPS gained popularity quickly when they started. Ian offered some nice products and a good service. I even featured them on my first surprise post ever! But I\u2019m afraid it wasn\u2019t to last. At the end of May, messages began to surface about a node being offline. Shortly after, more nodes went offline. The rumor is that Ian\u2019s wife died, though we have never heard from Ian himself. Currently, everything that was TacticalVPS seems to be unreachable and I have no faith it will be back up again soon.</p><p><span id=\"more-5327\"></span></p><hr><p><strong><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LowEND_\u2014_Home_-_2014-06-12_06.34.43-300x190.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LowEND_\u2014_Home_-_2014-06-12_06.34.43-300x190.png.webp\" alt=\"LowEND_\u2014_Home_-_2014-06-12_06.34.43\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" data-was-processed=\"true\">LowEnd.co</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Status:</span> admitted to deadpooling/closing shop</p><p><strong>WARNING: LowEnd.co\u2019s website is still online and the owner was banned for suspicious activities from LowEndTalk.

The domain was registered in January 2014 by Michael Long and shortly after LowEnd.co opened up shop. After having some issues with another provider they were renting dedicated servers to, LowEnd put up a notice on their website claiming they deadpooled. It turned out that the owner and his business partner were very shady and have been dishonest to a lot of people. They were eventually banned for SCAM-like activities on LowEndTalk, so please use extreme caution when dealing with these people.</p><hr><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RaidLogic-NET-A-Robust-Network-of-Fail-Safe-Internet-Data-Centers-2014-03-12-06-12-51-300x187.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RaidLogic-NET-A-Robust-Network-of-Fail-Safe-Internet-Data-Centers-2014-03-12-06-12-51-300x187.png.webp\" alt=\"RaidLogic-NET-A-Robust-Network-of-Fail-Safe-Internet-Data-Centers- 2014-03-12 06-12-51\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" data-was-processed=\"true\"><strong>RaidLogic</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Status:</span> website unreachable</p><p>We have featured RaidLogic several times over the past two years. In early June, messages began to appear that they were unreachable. To this day, there has been no official announcement regarding their closure, but all seems to be offline. There is a rumor that their assets were sold to another company, but not the clients or the brand, which could explain their sudden disappearance. If anybody close to RaidLogic knows more about their closure, feel free to contact us so we may be able to enlighten this a bit more for our users.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BeastVM_-_2014-06-12_06.34.27-300x187.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BeastVM_-_2014-06-12_06.34.27-300x187.png.webp\" alt=\"BeastVM_-_2014-06-12_06.34.27\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" data-was-processed=\"true\">BeastVM</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Status:</span> shut down</p><p>BeastVM officially closed its doors on June 5th. Due to \u201cpersonal reasons &amp; situations beyond our control\u201d they have decided to close shop. They did refund those who purchased in the last five days leading up to the announcement. Those who still had more than 15 days of service remaining received a partial refund. Despite people getting refunds, the notice was shared on LowEndTalk first on June 8th, which leads me to conclude people weren\u2019t given a whole lot of time to prepare to move out\u2026</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This concludes my first ever deadpool post.
