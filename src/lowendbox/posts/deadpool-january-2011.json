After a <a href=\"/blog/deadpool-december-2010/\">quiet month in December</a>, list of dead providers seem to be picking up again! I did make some changes to my tracker which flags more positives. If size of the content of the website is too small (under 1kb for example), then the provider is flagged as DOWN as they might have replaced their home page with a blank page (common with provider who just did a runner). It did pick up some extra dead providers, whom might have already died for a while.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/bradshosting2.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"Brads Hosting\"> Brad\u2019s Hosting</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP not resolvable</p><p><a href=\"/tag/bradshosting-com/\"><b>Brad\u2019s Hosting</b></a> was <a href=\"/blog/bradhosting-6-95-96mb-openvz-vps/\">first featured in LowEndBox.com</a> with their $6.95 95MB OpenVZ VPS back in August 2010. Wasn\u2019t really an impressive offering at the beginning. Their website moved a few times, and later on Brad the CEO <a href=\"/blog/brads-hosting-6-256mb-openvz-vps/#comment-12690\">commented that they are moving to SingleHop</a> in November. It did happen on 6 November 2010. On 12 December they put the WHOIS privacy mask on their domain again, and their IP is no longer resolvable by 6 January. Brad\u2019s WHT account is currently disabled so I have no idea what happened to them. Nor do I think they have many clients anyway.</p><p><span id=\"more-1628\"></span></p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/cloudstatic.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"CloudStatic\"> CloudStatic</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Blank page</p><p><a href=\"/blog/cloudstatic-3-75-256mb-openvz-vps/\"><b>CloudStatic</b></a> tried to pull a quickies back in Christmas time in December. \u201cAnthony Santos\u201d emailed me their offer on 23 December (if that\u2019s his real name), and by 21 January their website is already down showing a blank page (<em>yes, in less than a month</em>). IP hasn\u2019t changed, and their current server is now owned by \u201cReadyWebSpace.com\u201d a newly registered web hosting company owned by \u201ceFlipDomains\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7234150&amp;postcount=7\">Message on WHT</a> says they have been taken over, but somehow I don\u2019t have a good feeling about this.

Looks like Matthew is now focusing on <a href=\"/tag/pogiweb-com/\">PogiWeb</a> instead. I can\u2019t really work out the reason for rebranding (probably someone who has read more news on WHT can share with us), but HostPengiun is established on a 2007 domain whereas PogiWeb is pretty new. Maybe \u201cPenguin\u201d is preventing Matt from selling FreeBSD or Windows hosting?</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/hostvillage2.jpg\" alt=\"HostVillage\" class=\"screenshot\"> HostVillage</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP not resolvable</p><p>First post about <a href=\"/tag/hostvillage-com/\"><b>HostVillage</b></a> was from June 2010 with their $2.49 LowEndBox specials \u2014 which turns out to be a confusion as they merely wanted me to <em>pay</em> to review their hosting. Anyway, they subsequently offered a few more offers, and even purchased one advertisement spot (which is hopefully cancelling soon). They moved the website to Linode on 9 Jan (on a server announcing itself as \u6587\u80dc\u5229.com), and then on 19 Jan their website stopped resolving. Here is another example where age of domain name cannot be trusted \u2014 they are sitting on an 11-year-old domain!</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/nwabytes.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"NWABytes\"> NWABytes</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Empty website</p><p>Again here is someone I first reported on 6 December, and now the whole website ceases to exist after less than 2 months. <a href=\"/blog/nwa-bytes-6-39-256mb-openvz-vps/\"><b>NWA Bytes</b></a> was offering 256MB OpenVZ VPS for $6.39. \u201cKevin\u201d has lost the .com version of their domain to domain squatters so he settled on the .net domain.
