So let\u2019s get started with the interview!</span></p><p><strong>Tell me about your background and your company\u2019s history?</strong></p><p>I was a commerce student with no technical background, but always had an interest in technical things. I initially started out as a hacker but soon realized that was the wrong career path for me. I bought the domain name, prolimehosting.com, in 2002 from rented money and started to offer shared hosting. Two or three years later, ProlimeHosting had grown to 300 clients at which time I changed our domain to ProlimeHost.com.</p><p>At that time, I decided to transition to reselling dedicated servers. Unfortunately, the dedicated server market was very tough, so with zero money to invest, I struggled. A high school friend who had moved to the USA loaned me $150 to purchase a dedicated server, and I in turn resold it to an existing shared hosting client. Since then, I\u2019ve never looked back.</p><p>Today, we service clients across the globe, offering VPS and dedicated servers from multiple data centers.</p><p><span id=\"more-22715\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What would you tell someone looking to start a hosting company today? What advice would you offer?</strong></p><p>I\u2019d tell anyone who is looking to start a hosting company today to think big, but plan out your launch in achievable steps. Focus on your local community. Put yourself out there and network. Prospects connect with businesses and representatives that they know, like and trust. Building that business relationship means taking a sincere interest in their business. It boils down to helping each other.</p><p>Don\u2019t try to compete with the big boys on price, rather strive to develop raving fans of your services. That\u2019s accomplished by going that extra one percent in every interaction with your prospects and clients, from billing to sales. Bottom line though is that you have to be profitable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where do you think the future takes the hosting industry?</strong></p><p>I remember back to the days of 300 baud acoustic modems and $1000/month T-1\u2019s on three year contracts. Technology has evolved exponentially since then and will continue to do so. In terms of hardware, advances in processor, storage devices and RAM rule the day AND the future. Layer on advances in software development and global Internet availability, and the future continues to be promising. We haven\u2019t begun to scratch the surface of possibilities.</p><p>Due to COVID-19 shutdowns, shortages in the industry\u2019s supply chain will disrupt near future transactions, but I fully expect an economic recovery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What makes your company unique in today\u2019s evolving market landscape? How are you evolving with the times?</strong></p><p>What makes ProlimeHost unique in today\u2019s evolving market landscape is our approach to customer support and in our determination to evolve with the times, to the benefit of our clients.</p><p>This begins with hiring competent, professional support staff, coupled with incentives for them to pursue industry specific continuing education.</p><p>We believe that by offering a flexible and scalable infrastructure, we\u2019re able to serve a variety of audiences with cost-effective solutions, within the reach of individuals and small businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you enjoy most about your role? What do you find most difficult?</strong></p><p>What I enjoy most about my role is the satisfaction that comes from providing a truly quality service for our clients, whether that be a simple bare bones server to more complex solutions.</p><p>What I find most difficult is balancing the line on price points, simply because we need to maintain a positive return on our infrastructure investments to adequately provide premium services to our clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Both personally and professionally, what guiding principles ground you?</strong></p><p>The guiding principles that ground me, both personally and professionally, begin with always dreaming big, but balancing that against a healthy dose of reality. It\u2019s been said that life has rules and structure, but imagination does not. Toward that end, I\u2019m committed to the principles of tenacity and agility, always pushing past adversity with optimism. I firmly believe in the old saying, \u201cnothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Give us some details on new and exciting things you are working on?</strong></p><p>Right now, we are working on adding a new line of cloud services. We firmly believe once the world is free of Covid-19 restrictions, that more and more businesses will be looking to cloud services to remain lean and competitive. Our goal will be to offer small businesses more options than ever before to drive operational efficiency with computing power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why should customers trust you and your business?</strong></p><p>We fully understand that trust is paramount in the hosting industry, so we routinely publish content that\u2019s personal, meaningful and relevant, and share that across social media portals. Check out our blog. I think you\u2019ll be impressed.</p><p>Bottom line \u2013 over the past two decades, we\u2019ve grown exponentially because we focus on developing raving fans and not simply satisfied customers. Our goal has always been to \u2018exceed\u2019 our clients expectations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final thoughts and anything you would like to add?</strong></p><p>I do want to thank you for this opportunity to highlight <a href=\"https://www.prolimehost.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ProlimeHost</a>. It\u2019s been an amazing ride so far, and we\u2019re all looking forward to bigger and better things this year.</p><p>Regarding Covid-19, we\u2019d like to remind everyone to stay safe.
