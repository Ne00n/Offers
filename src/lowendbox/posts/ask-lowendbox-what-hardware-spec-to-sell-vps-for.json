To protect him from possible future persecution so I am masking out the name :) Anyway, he asked</p><blockquote><p>I was wonding what people would expect to see as the base specifictions as a low end VPS host box.</p><p>Having a look at some dedicated server deals it seems something like a 1x Intel Xeon x3460 at 2.8 GHz with 4 GB DDR3 ECC \u2014 would be the minimum to make this viable to sell 128mb VPS servers off at a lowend box rate.</p><p>So what I\u2019m going to put out to the community is what do you expect to see as the hardware for the host node?</p></blockquote><p>Okay. I have never been on the provider side of the table so I have no idea. However from what I can see here, it tends to go two extremes</p><ul><li>Cheap desktop Pentium box or 3-4 year-old old server hardware with small amount of RAM (4-8GB) and software RAID1 of SATA2 drives. Sell 10-15 VPS on it.</li><li>Expensive dual quad core Xeon boxes and latest hardware, with 32GB+ memory and 6x SAS drives. Sell 50+ VPS on it.</li></ul><p>Well the numbers are purely pulling out from nowhere so don\u2019t be surprised that they are completely out of whack. Both are acceptable for slicing up to provide low end boxes I guess, and I guess the performance would be similar. You either get less contention on cheap box or more on high performance beast.</p><p>However at the sub-$7 end I am actually not \u201cexpecting\u201d any kind of performance. I would actually much prefer stability and <em>consistensy</em> than being able to burst to 4x 2.8GHz one day, and complete unresponsive because of IO-wait on the other.</p><p>Anyway. Xeon X3460 is a good quad core CPU. Up the memory to 8GB so you can jam more virtual servers on it. Also don\u2019t forget that RAID1 would be the bare minimum :)</p><p>As potential customers of a low end virtual server, what is your expectation?</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fask-lowendbox-what-hardware-spec-to-sell-vps-for%2F&amp;t=Ask%20LowEndBox%20-%20What%20Hardware%20Spec%20to%20Sell%20VPS%20for%3F\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ask%20LowEndBox%20-%20What%20Hardware%20Spec%20to%20Sell%20VPS%20for%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fask-lowendbox-what-hardware-spec-to-sell-vps-for%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fask-lowendbox-what-hardware-spec-to-sell-vps-for%2F&amp;title=Ask%20LowEndBox%20-%20What%20Hardware%20Spec%20to%20Sell%20VPS%20for%3F&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
