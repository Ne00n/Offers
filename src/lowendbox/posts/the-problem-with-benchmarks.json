Users signed up for cheap VPSes \u2013 sometimes many more than they really needed \u2013 and proceeded to excitedly run YABS and post the results. Amusingly, this usually means that performance on BF/CM nodes is worse for the 24-48 hours after purchase because there is so much of this activity going on.</p><p>YABS \u2013 and many others like it over the years \u2013 attempts to produce a meaningful report to judge or grade the VM. It reports CPU type and other configuration information, then runs various disk, network, and CPU tests to inform the user if the VPS service he\u2019s just bought is good, bad, or middling. But does it really?</p><p>It\u2019s valid to check CPU and disk performance for outliers. We\u2019ve all seen overcrowded nodes. Hopefully, network performance is checked prior to purchase through test files and Looking Glass. But other than excluding ancient CPUs and floppy-drive-level performance, is the user really likely to notice a difference day-in and day-out between a 3.3Ghz CPU and a 3.4Ghz one? Particularly since any operation touches many often-virtualized subsystems.</p><p>If I could write a benchmark suite, here is what I would like it to report.<span id=\"more-26171\"></span></p><h3>Reliability</h3><p>How often does the providers\u2019 hardware go bump in the night? How often does the network falter? I care less about that extra few MB/sec in a synthetic benchmark and more about how my rsync backups flow or web pages are served around the clock.</p><h3>Problems</h3><p>Every provider has issues \u2013 whether you\u2019re MomNPop.hosting or Amazon. The question is how they respond them. Does the provider dawdle or are they right on the spot? Are they open and transparent? Do they communicate well? I can think of several providers who had issues and then went silent \u2013 which is disastrous. On the other hand, I was affected by an outage with a prominent LET provider years ago and they sent hourly status reports until it was resolved. Which would you feel better hosting with?</p><h3>Support</h3><p>I generally don\u2019t need hand-holding \u2013 though if I was paying for managed hosting, I\u2019d expect it to be excellent. But eventually everyone needs support of some kind. I went round and round with a host once because my outbound mail was blocked. Their support insisted it was something in my VPS and wanted to charge me to look at it. Eventually it escalated to someone more senior who said they block outgoing mail but they could unblock me. That\u2019s an example of how even no-support hosts must provide some support.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>I\u2019m responsible for keeping my VPS secure. No worries. But if the hypervisor is hacked, there\u2019s nothing I can do. How much do you trust the provider? Even worse, what if their panel is hacked and attackers can get in on any console? Or if their WHMCS is hacked and your credentials are sold into a hundred black markets?</p><h3>Moldy Oldies</h3><p>You find a great Black Friday deal, eagerly send your money, and then\u2026discover they haven\u2019t updated their VM templates since the Beijing Olympics.&nbsp; And what of next year when the next great Debian distro comes out \u2013 how long am I going to have to wait for their \u201cvalidation\u201d?</p><h3>Previous Residents</h3><p>When my provider hands me an IP, is it on every RBL from Bangor to Bangkok? Am I going to find the reverse DNS is set to domain called \u201ci-love-kiddie-porn.com\u201d? (Yes, this actually happened \u2013 previous owner thought it was funny. If I hadn\u2019t noticed, could have been a headache down the road.)</p><h3>My Neighbors</h3><p>Is someone trying to mine LowEndCoins on my physical node and burning CPU 24\u00d77? Is someone running a DDoS-magnet gameserver?</p><h3>Hard to Quantify</h3><p>Unfortunately, all of these things are impossible to quantify in a shell script. If you ask me which providers I recommend, the benchmarks that result from VMs on their nodes are not likely to factor into my response. Rather, I\u2019ll point to the provider\u2019s history and these \u201cunquantifiables\u201d as major considerations on which providers to choose.</p><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/new-benchmarking-series-on-lowendtalk/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"New Benchmarking Series on LowEndTalk\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/leb-centered-small.jpg) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">New Benchmarking Series on LowEndTalk</div></div></a></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/raindog308/\" title=\"All posts by raindog308\" rel=\"author\">raindog308</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/raindog308\" class=\"bio-icon bio-icon-website\"></a><p class=\"bio-description\">I'm Andrew, techno polymath and long-time LowEndTalk community Moderator.
