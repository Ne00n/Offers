This week, it\u2019s time to add devices to Observium. In order to add a device to Observium, the device must support SNMP/have SNMP software installed. SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol and is a protocol that was designed for monitoring and management purposes for network-connected devices. It\u2019s quite a simple protocol but very powerful, mainly because so many devices understand it (servers, switches, printers, routers, etc.).</p><p>On Ubuntu and CentOS a tool called SNMPd is used to listen to, and answer to, requests over the SNMP protocol.&nbsp; I\u2019m going to show you how to install the this tool in both Ubuntu and CentOS. After that, I\u2019m going to show you how to add those devices to your Observium installation.</p><p><span id=\"more-5053\"></span></p><h2>SNMPd on Ubuntu</h2><p>First, update the apt cache. On new installations a lot of packages may not be found because they haven\u2019t been cached yet.</p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-get update</p></blockquote><p>Now install SNMPd:</p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install snmpd</p></blockquote><p>And open up the configuration file:</p><blockquote><p>sudo vim /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf</p></blockquote><p>What you see in this file is default/example configuration. We\u2019re going to ditch all of it and replace it with our custom configuration. This is the configuration we\u2019re going to put in there:</p><blockquote><p>com2sec readonly&nbsp;192.0.2.5 lowendbox<br>\ngroup MyROGroup v1 readonly<br>\ngroup MyROGroup v2c readonly<br>\ngroup MyROGroup usm readonly<br>\nview all included .1 80<br>\naccess MyROGroup \u201c\u201d any noauth exact all none none<br>\nsyslocation \u201cMilan, Italy\u201d<br>\nsyscontact operations@example.net</p></blockquote><p>It looks complicated, but it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s go over this line by line and I\u2019ll explain what everything does <em>and</em> what you have to change (TL;DR: \u2018lowendbox\u2019 is the community name, this is up to you; syslocation is the location of the system; syscontact is the contact e-mail address for this system).</p><blockquote><p>com2sec readonly&nbsp;192.0.2.5 lowendbox</p></blockquote><p>This line maps a community name (in this case \u2018lowendbox\u2019) to a security string. A security string is an access policy and an optional IP address limitation. If you want to allow all IP addresses, you could replace the IP address in my example configuration with the word \u2018default\u2019. com2sec6 is the IPv6 ecquivalent to this. You can either give it a single IP address, an IP address and a netmask, or an IP range in CIDR block notation. I\u2019ve chosen to limit access over SNMP to my Observium server.</p><blockquote><p>group MyROGroup v1 readonly<br>\ngroup MyROGroup v2c readonly<br>\ngroup MyROGroup usm readonly</p></blockquote><p>These lines map a group (in this case \u2018MyROGroup\u2019) to a security name (in this case \u2018v1 readonly\u2019, \u2018v2c readonly\u2019, and \u2018usm readonly\u2019). We do this for the security model of three versions of SNMP: v1, v2c, and USM. V1 is the oldest of all, while the community-based V2c model is still used very frequently. Both of them use VACM (View-Based Access Control Model). USM (User-Based Security Model) is the newest of all and part of SNMP v3, but more complicated to configure. USM allows for user-based access, which could eventually be more suitable in more complex setups. We\u2019re mapping these all because VACM requires them for both v1 and v2c, and, for future expansion, having the line added for USM can\u2019t hurt.</p><blockquote><p>view all included .1 80</p></blockquote><p>This line is a bit more complicated. This defines a \u2018view\u2019, which defines what you are allowed to view when contacting this device over SNMP. This view is named \u2018all\u2019. After that, you see \u2018included .1 80\u2019. This is sort of an \u201caccess policy\u201d to the MIB tree that SNMP makes available (MIB stands for Management Information Base).&nbsp; Every bit of data in there has an OID (\u2018Object IDentifier\u2019). Simple said, the MIB tree contains a lot of information about your system. By defining access to a certain OID (which can be a simple piece of data or an entire tree), you can disclose that over SNMP. \u2018Included\u2019 is the keyword that tells SNMPd to include the data of the OID string you pass. \u2018Excluded\u2019 is the alternative here, with which you can exclude certain data. The OID string we pass here (\u2018.1\u2019) gives access to the entire \u2018iso\u2019 MIB tree of data that SNMP has. To see what\u2019s possibly in there, take a look here: <a href=\"http://oid-info.com/cgi-bin/display?tree=1&amp;see=all\">http://oid-info.com/cgi-bin/display?tree=1&amp;see=all</a>. But because not <em>all</em> of that is necessary, we\u2019re limiting access to the .1 tree by setting a <em>mask</em> which is in hexadecimal notation. In this case that mask is 80 (it\u2019s full form is \u2018ff.80), which limits the access we give to a certain subtree of the .1 MIB tree. I haven\u2019t been enable to find a proper overview of what you can exactly see, but it\u2019s a long list of data, which includes network, CPU, memory, and drive information. If anybody can find a sane overview of this, please let me know.</p><blockquote><p>access MyROGroup \u201c\u201d any noauth exact all none none</p></blockquote><p>With this line, we actually tie the group we\u2019ve added before to an access rule. In this case the \u2018MyROGroup\u2019, in any context (\u201c\u201d), can access the data over any version of the protocol (\u2018any\u2019), without authentication (\u2018noauth\u2019), matching the exact context (\u2018exact\u2019), allowing access to all <em>view</em> rules (\u2018all\u2019), but no write (\u2018none\u2019), or modify access (\u2018none\u2019). The context is what we have limited with com2sec. If you have a loose com2sec policy, you can control access from certain devices with certain IP addresses here. So, you could theoretically allow access from all IP addresses with com2sec and then limit access by IP address here. It wouldn\u2019t have my preference, though.</p><blockquote><p>syslocation \u201cMilan, Italy\u201d<br>\nsyscontact operations@example.net</p></blockquote><p>The last two lines are actually simple. These note the location of the system (Observium uses this for the map it has) and the system contact. Adjust these to your situation.</p><p>Once that\u2019s done, save the file, and your initial configuration is done! Finally, restart SNMPd:</p><blockquote><p>sudo service snmpd restart</p></blockquote><p>And you\u2019re done! You can now add the device to Observium!</p><h2>SNMPd on CentOS</h2><p>CentOS has the SNMPd Perl packages in the default repository, so we can install them right away:</p><blockquote><p>sudo yum install net-snmp-utils net-snmp</p></blockquote><p>Now, make sure the daemon starts when CentOS starts:</p><blockquote><p>sudo chkconfig snmpd on</p></blockquote><p>And open up the configuration file:</p><blockquote><p>sudo vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf</p></blockquote><p>What you see in this file is default/example configuration. We\u2019re going to ditch all of it and replace it with our custom configuration.

You can now add the device to Observium!</p><h2>Adding the device to observium</h2><p>Final step is to add the device you have just installed SNMPd on to Observium. To do this, log into Observium. In the top menu, select \u2018Devices\u2019 and then \u2018Add device\u2019. This will take you to the following page:</p><p><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Observium_Network_Observation_and_Monitoring_-_Add_host_-_2014-04-05_08.19.16.png\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyNTQiIGhlaWdodD0iMzAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjU0IDMwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5054\" alt=\"Observium_Network_Observation_and_Monitoring_-_Add_host_-_2014-04-05_08.19.16\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Observium_Network_Observation_and_Monitoring_-_Add_host_-_2014-04-05_08.19.16-254x300.png.webp\" width=\"254\" height=\"300\" data-srcset=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Observium_Network_Observation_and_Monitoring_-_Add_host_-_2014-04-05_08.19.16-254x300.png.webp 254w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Observium_Network_Observation_and_Monitoring_-_Add_host_-_2014-04-05_08.19.16-868x1024.png.webp 868w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Observium_Network_Observation_and_Monitoring_-_Add_host_-_2014-04-05_08.19.16.png.webp 929w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\"></a></p><p>In the \u2018Hostname\u2019 field, fill in the host name of the server you want to add. Then, at \u2018SNMPv1/v2c Configuration\u2019, the field \u2018SNMP Community\u2019, input the community name you have used before. In my example it was \u2018lowendbox\u2019. When done, click the green \u2018Add Device\u2019 button. The device should now be added to your Observium installation. If you get an error message, be sure to check:</p><ul><li>the connectivity between the Observium server and the device you would like to add</li><li>whether you have restarted SNMPd after changing the configuration</li><li>your firewall</li></ul><p>Those are the most common causes for Observium to tell you the device cannot be added.</p><p>After about 15 minutes, the first poll should have been done. From that point on, you should start seeing data.</p><p>Congratulations, you\u2019re done! You\u2019ve now got a fully working Observium installation with your first device added!</p><h2>The extra step</h2><p>If you want proper information about you\u2019re device\u2019s distribution (and the version/architecture) in Observium, there\u2019s a couple of extra steps to take. First, get the tool from Observium that gathers the proper data:</p><blockquote><p>wget http://www.observium.org/svn/observer/trunk/scripts/distro</p></blockquote><p>Now, move it to the /usr/bin directory:</p><blockquote><p>sudo mv distro /usr/bin/distro</p></blockquote><p>And make it executable:</p><blockquote><p>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/distro</p></blockquote><p>Finally, add the following line to your /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:</p><blockquote><p>extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.1 distro /usr/bin/distro</p></blockquote><p>This line extends the above \u2018view\u2019 policy and allows access to the distro information over SNMP. As you can see, the OID string here is a lot more complex than the one above, and is really limited to a small subset of information.</p><p>Save the file and restart SNMPd:</p><blockquote><p>sudo service snmpd restart</p></blockquote><p>And within 15 minutes or so, Observium should pick up on the additional data!</p><h2>Final notes</h2><p>While installing Observium isn\u2019t complicated, configuring the SNMP daemon could be. As you will have undoubtedly noticed, the MIB tree and OID string are something that requires more in-depth knowledge to figure out yourself. It\u2019s a good thing to read a bit more about this.</p><p>To actually see what data <em>does</em> get passed to Observium, you can use the following command from the Observium server (this <em>does</em> require to have the SNMPd packages installed):</p><blockquote><p>snmpwalk -mALL -v2c -clowendbox 192.0.2.51 .1 80</p></blockquote><p>Replace \u2018-clowendbox\u2019 with \u2018-c\u2019 followed by your community name and 192.0.2.51 with the IP address of the device you want to check.This should spit out a long, long list of data. This is the list Observium gets as well.
