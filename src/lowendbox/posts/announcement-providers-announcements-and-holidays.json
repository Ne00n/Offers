I would not like to disturb the flow at LowEndBox.com with announcements targeted at providers, so moving them to the helpdesk seems like a sensible idea. LowEndTalk related announcements will still be made at LowEndTalk, for both end-users and providers. End-user announcements regarding LowEndBox.com will still be made at LowEndBox.com.</p><h2>Holiday season</h2><p>Tthe following has been posted <a href=\"http://helpdesk.lowendbox.com/index.php?module=announce&amp;sec=view&amp;id=4\">at the helpdesk</a> as well.</p><p>The holiday season is coming up and I\u2019d really like to make it a fantastic season this year, also at LowEndBox! Therefore, I\u2019ve come up with a schedule that enables me to post a nice amount of offers during the holidays. This is the schedule I came up with:</p><ul><li>Black Friday: 4 offers (randomly drawn), each posted 6 hours after the other, starting at midnight</li><li>Christmas Eve: 1 offer (randomly drawn), 12 hours, from noon to midnight</li><li>Christmas Day: 4 offers (randomly drawn), each posted 6 hours after the other, starting at midnight</li><li>Boxing Day: 4 offers (randomly drawn), each posted 6 hours after the other, starting at midnight</li></ul><p>This is how it will work: providers can submit offers up to a certain deadline, at which point I will group them together in a special category in the helpdesk and <em>randomly</em> draw offers from them to be posted. You <em>will</em> be notified in advance about whether your offer will be posted or not, and if yes, when. Please do note: I will probably use canned responses for this to save my fingers a bit ;-)</p><h3>Separate tickets</h3><p>Holiday offers should be submitted outside/in addition to your normal offers. So a normal offer doesn\u2019t participate in the holiday draws and vice versa. You <em>may</em> submit different tickets for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but you can use one for both. After the holidays, all holiday tickets will be closed. If you were drawn for Thanksgiving, you still participate in the Christmas draw.</p><h3>Deadlines</h3><p>There will be submission deadlines for these special holiday offers, otherwise I simply can\u2019t write them all in time. The deadline schedule is:</p><ul><li>Black Friday offers: 24 November at midnight UTC</li><li>Christmas offers: 20 December at midnight UTC</li></ul><p>Please make sure any offers are submitted <em>before</em> the deadline. Especially for Christmas, I need to write 9 offers in addition to the normal ones. I have Christmas parties and festivities as well, so I\u2019d like to write them ahead of time :-)</p><p>Thank you all for your cooperation and I look forward to your offers!</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fannouncement-providers-announcements-and-holidays%2F&amp;t=%5BUPDATED%5D%20Providers%3A%20announcements%20and%20holidays\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%5BUPDATED%5D%20Providers%3A%20announcements%20and%20holidays&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fannouncement-providers-announcements-and-holidays%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fannouncement-providers-announcements-and-holidays%2F&amp;title=%5BUPDATED%5D%20Providers%3A%20announcements%20and%20holidays&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/mpkossen/\" title=\"All posts by Maarten Kossen\" rel=\"author\">Maarten Kossen</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">Maarten Kossen was the administrator of LowEndBox from 2013 to 2015, and brought many ideas and improvements to the website during his leadership.
