Instead of people suggesting a VPS provider to suit his need, how about we use the voting feature on OSQA to have regular Low End VPS provider recommendations? Instead of me creating a big table and listing out hosting providers that <em>pays me the most</em> (hey I can see GoDaddy, BlueHost and HostGator there!) It is <b>your turn</b> to recommend your fellow community members a fast, stable and cheap VPS.</p><p>I am planning to run it regularly but not as often as once per month \u2014 maybe once per quarter. For now, <a href=\"http://dev.lowendtalk.com/questions/64/low-end-vps-rankingrating-for-2010-q4\"><b>head down to the current recommendation discussion topic</b></a>, and</p><ul><li>Check whether the provider has already been nominated.
