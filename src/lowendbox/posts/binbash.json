Over the past week we have been working towards a \u201cplan\u201d for LEB/LET that would bring this place forward. The LowEndBox market is incredible, unique, and has a couple of main driving factors. Generally those trying to grab the cheapest possible VPS, and those trying to squeeze the most out of the smallest possible VPS. The most interesting posts generally come from the second of the two groups, and discussions become interesting and informative.</p><p>However over time LowEndAdmin grew tired of the kids \u201cplotting their next pump \u2018n dump\u201d on LEB/LET, and this was a deciding factor for him moving on. In this time \u201cA Trio\u201d of us was left with LEB/LET, and we have been discussing ways privately that we can make this a better place. LowEndBox is not LowEndStartup, and while we always want new providers and new competition, we also want to be promoting providers whom have a proven record, or are of a higher percentage of being around in six months to a year.</p><p><span id=\"more-2343\"></span></p><p>To assist in this we have added some basic new rules to accepting LEB offers:<br>\n* Using a nulled WHMCS grants you a lifetime ban on LowEndBox and LowEndTalk.<br>\n* Hosts posting offers are not to use Private WHOIS data on their domain</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/1/low-end-vps-offer-posting-rules-update-2012\">I invite you also to join the discussion on LET</a> as well and suggest what other safeguards you would like to see. LEB is a place for quality, not quantity, it would be better that we promote 10 hosts who are still in existence in 12 months, than 25 hosts who have all disappeared in 3 months.</p><p><strong>We will start taking offers and new plans from Friday 3rd February</strong> for posting on LEB, and will work towards a dedicated \u201cDeadPool\u201d page as some are already looking to return post-Christmas.</p><p>We are clearing the backlog in Moderation and Flagged comments, posts, spam etc. So if you see anything that you believe is in breach flag it, and after Friday you should see a quicker, more timely response to flagged items.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbinbash%2F&amp;t=%23%21%2Fbin%2Fbash\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%23%21%2Fbin%2Fbash&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbinbash%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbinbash%2F&amp;title=%23%21%2Fbin%2Fbash&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/chief/\" title=\"All posts by Chief\" rel=\"author\">Chief</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/95eb0c6933c92c8ef8d33a9c64f4314b?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/95eb0c6933c92c8ef8d33a9c64f4314b?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.lowendbox.com\" class=\"bio-icon bio-icon-website\"></a><p class=\"bio-description\"></p></div></div><div class=\"feedback\"></div></div>"}
