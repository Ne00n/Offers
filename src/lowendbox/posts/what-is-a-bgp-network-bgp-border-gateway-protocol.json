Not to worry \u2013 this can be a good thing, and it means your provider runs a multi-homed network consisting of multiple ISP (internet service provider)\u2019s in the mix. This means redundancy and performance is optimized.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-22810\"></span></p><p><b>Before we begin, let\u2019s define some specialized terminology:</b><b><br>\n</b></p><p><b>BGP </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stands for </span><b>B</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">order </span><b>G</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ateway </span><b>P</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rotocol \u2013 with a BGP network, it will automatically analyze and select the best network route to take.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><b>Tier 1 ISP</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stands for an Internet Service Provider that can handle traffic from a wide variety of sources (access to the global internet) \u2013 such as your home internet provider. Examples of a Tier 1 ISP include: AT&amp;T, Comcast, Verizon, Sprint, NTT, GTT, Cogent, Zayo, and more.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give an illustrative example, let\u2019s say you are located in Denver and your ISP is AT&amp;T. Let\u2019s say the best route to access your server in Chicago would be to take a route involving the tier 1 ISP provider Cogent. However, internet weather can always vary \u2013 so for example 2 weeks later, the best route that gets you the lowest amount of hops and latency might be another provider instead of Cogent, i.e. GTT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, BGP will help route traffic over the best route in the blend the hosting provider has available \u2013 offering lowest latency at all times (determining the best network path to take). For example, RackNerd\u2019s Los Angeles DC-02 location includes: CenturyLink, Cogent, GTT, NTT, China Telecom, China Unicom, and ChinaNet in its premium BGP network mix.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As another illustrative example using RackNerd\u2019s network blend described above, let\u2019s say NTT has an outage, and your ISP generally prefers to take routes over NTT. What if NTT has an outage? Well, </span><b>if </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your provider is single-homed (meaning they do not have a BGP network, and only have one ISP in the network blend) that means your server\u2019s network would become inaccessible until NTT sorts out the outage. With a BGP network mix, it will automatically re-route against the problematic carrier (in this example, NTT) to another carrier, all without any downtime or interruption to your server.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can tell, not only is a BGP network important but what\u2019s more important is the network providers within the blend. For example, a provider that only has Cogent and Zayo may be classified as more of a \u201cbudget\u201d hosting experience versus a hosting provider that has more than a couple network carriers in their BGP mix, who would otherwise be classified as \u201cpremium.\u201d Please note your definition of \u201cbudget\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d may vary based upon your requirements and preferred ISP routing (your mileage may vary!) \u2013 this is only for example purposes, but it goes without saying that the more carriers, the better. So before buying your VPS \u2013 be sure to check with your provider and ask them what network carriers are included in their network mix. You could even ask how their network is structured/designed so that you can understand the redundancy they have in place. Another good thing to look at is the provider\u2019s service level agreement, this typically includes guarantees and compensation details.</span></p><p><b>Network Capacity is important!</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sure \u2013 the more carriers, the better\u2026 but what\u2019s the point if capacity is so small/limited with one carrier that it is not even being utilized in a real world environment? With that being said, be sure to also inquire with your provider before purchasing how much capacity they have with every ISP in their network blend. To help verify this, you can also ask for a </span><a href=\"https://blog.racknerd.com/what-is-a-looking-glass/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking Glass</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 which will contain a test IP and test file that you can use to run traceroutes and verify which route/ISP\u2019s that you are taking from your location. You can test from several other source locations by using a website such as </span><a href=\"http://ping.pe/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://ping.pe/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to test the Looking Glass Test IP, and verifying the network paths that various remote locations are taking.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Does your VPS or hosting provider have a BGP network blend?
