Cisneros<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a 12 year industry veteran, and who currently serves as </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd\u2019s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> CEO to offer his thoughts on the topic. His company is a reputable Resident Host here within the LowEndBox community and is notable for its continued expansion including the opening of their new office space despite what is seemingly a shrinking economy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a new guest post shared by Dustin, he shares some tips on how to flourish and prosper even during an economic contraction. Seeing that a lot of LEB community members are entrepreneurs, small business owners, or hosting company operators, we hope that this article will add valuable takeaways and insight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a dozen years since the last major 2008 recession, 2020 has certainly taken an unexpected turn of events with COVID-19. It goes without saying that the United States, along with the rest of the world is experiencing economic turbulence during these \u201cnew normal\u201d times \u2013 so what can you do today to prepare and solidify your success and stability for the future?</span></p><p><span id=\"more-23589\"></span></p><p><b>Here are 5 key points to keep in mind:</b></p><p><b>1. Make a decision to expand.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a business owner or not \u2013 this applies to all areas of your life. First, it\u2019s important to understand that change starts with you. For example, I strive to be expanding across all my dynamics (family, business, relationships, work, etc). I see contractions as an opportunity that can put me at an advantage, because on the other side of this, I know that with the right actions, it\u2019ll put me in a stronger position in the future as a result of my actions today.</span></p><p><b>2. Increase Your Discipline.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s important to have more outflow (activity being put out) rather than inflow (i.e. watching Netflix). During these uncertain times when most of the world is under stay-at-home orders, those who will succeed the most are those who have an increased level of discipline to get things accomplished, even while at home.</span></p><p><b>3. Be Receptive to Change &amp; New Ideas.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The old way you previously used to do things isn\u2019t going to work anymore in the \u201cnew normal\u201d day and age that we live in. You\u2019re going to need to start operating with a mindset of control. Take action now, you\u2019re responsible for your own economy.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><p><b>4. Business Owners: Stay in Communication with Your Customers &amp; Vendors.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is key! Staying in communication with your customers, vendors, and partners is crucial more than ever before to ensure the long term success of your business during these times. Keep your customers in the loop with frequent email &amp; social media updates, and continue to find creative ways to expand your value delivery.</span><br>\n<img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/racknerd-new-office.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot alignnone litespeed-loaded\" title=\"RackNerd's New Office Location in California\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/racknerd-new-office.jpg.webp\" alt=\"RackNerd's New Office Location in California\" width=\"339\" height=\"254\" data-was-processed=\"true\"><br>\n<b>5. Invest in Your Skills. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use your extra stay-at-home time to invest in self-improvement and honing your skills. Don\u2019t hesitate to invest time, energy, and resources towards improving yourself, especially new times like this. Investing in yourself is always, without a doubt, the best investment you can ever make, in any economic status. Get committed to being exclamatory at what you do \u2013 rather than average. For example, when a company has to make a decision to furlough or lay off people, the safest ones are the ones who are absolutely stellar and go above and beyond on the job. Be sure to deliver, and always with the mindset of over-delivering.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the above actions on a consistent basis \u2013 my company, </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, has continued to expand, rather than contract even during these new times. As a way of example, we originally planned on opening our office space in October of 2020. We\u2019ve been fortunate enough to beat the goal \u2013 this month (May 2020), we toured offices, negotiated office space, and construction. Five months ahead of schedule, we signed the letter of intent, and are </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/racknerd/status/1260729133643915264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">moving forward with the opening of our new and expanded office in Upland, California</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a target opening date of June 1st, 2020. </span></p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyMjQiIGhlaWdodD0iMzAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjI0IDMwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot alignnone\" title=\"RackNerd Signs Lease New Office Location in California\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/racknerd-new-office-lease.jpg.webp\" alt=\"RackNerd Signs Lease for New Office Location in California\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of this, we\u2019re continuing to find ways to continue to add extra value to our customers. With the new office space, we will be supporting more staff members than ever before in our administration office, and as such \u2013 we will be able to deliver an unprecedented level of value delivery to our customers, offering faster and more solid support than the already-fast support our customers are accustomed to.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are one of those hungry individuals chasing success, personal and professional growth, I only encourage you to take the risk now!
