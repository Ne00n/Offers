Avoid the Big Boys</strong></h1><p>Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are the biggest public clouds and they sell to everyone from Fortune 100 companies to students.&nbsp; These clouds are robust, managed by professionals, jam-packed with API features, and offer an astonishing range of features and options.&nbsp; However, they\u2019re also among the most expensive choices.&nbsp; One of the key reasons is that they charge by the gigabyte for bandwidth.&nbsp; Many providers bundle a generous amount of bandwidth with their VMs, but the big public clouds charge by the gigabyte.</p><p>For example, if you buy a $5/mo VM at Digital Ocean, Vultr, or Linode, you\u2019ll get 1TB of bandwidth included.&nbsp; At Amazon AWS (On Demand), you would get only the first 1GB free.&nbsp; After that, you pay 9 cents per GB (as of this article), which means that 1TB will cost you (999 * .09 =) <strong>$89.91</strong>!&nbsp; And that\u2019s without even paying for the VM itself.&nbsp; Now it\u2019s true that <em>inbound</em> bandwidth is free, but for typical use cases (such as web servers), you send much more data out than in.</p><p>Big public clouds certainly have their role but if you don\u2019t need their advanced API capabilities, you can find much cheaper options elsewhere.</p><p><span id=\"more-24316\"></span></p><h1><strong>2. Try Free Tiers</strong></h1><p>This is a slight contradiction to #1.&nbsp; Some of the big providers offer a free tier where you can try out their services for a year with no charge.&nbsp; For example, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&amp;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&amp;awsm.page-all-free-tier=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Free Tier</a> will let you run a micro-sized VM with 30GB of block storage for free for a year.</p><p>Be aware there are some important limitations:</p><ul><li>Typically only a small amount of bandwidth is included.&nbsp; For Amazon, this is 15GB a month.&nbsp; You\u2019ll be on the hook for any overages.</li><li>Free CPU usage <a href=\"https://scoutapm.com/blog/understanding-cpu-steal-time-when-should-you-be-worried\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is capped</a>.</li><li>After one year, you\u2019ll need to shut off your server or be charged at normal rates.</li></ul><p>Still, you can\u2019t beat the price and for some use cases, a small micro is perfect.</p><h1>3. Read Your Terms</h1><p>Many providers will let you cancel at the end of your term with no fees.&nbsp; So if your billing cycle renews on the 30th of the month and you cancel on the 30th, you owe nothing further.&nbsp; Some will simply shut off your server if you don\u2019t pay the bill and it\u2019s common for customers to just walk away when they\u2019re done.</p><p>But this is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> true of all hosts!&nbsp; Some require advance notice (e.g., 30 days\u2019 notice) and some require that you positively act to cancel your server.&nbsp; Some will go on charging you until you do this, and more than one has been known to send delinquent accounts to collections in your home country.&nbsp; It\u2019s your responsibility to read and understand what you\u2019re signing up for.</p><h1>4. Pay on an Annual Basis</h1><p>If you like a provider and they have a proven track record, see if they offer annual terms.&nbsp; For example, some providers will charge a monthly fee but only charge 10 months if you pay by the year.&nbsp; So if your VM is $10/month then you\u2019re only paying (10 * $10 = 100 / 12 = ) $8.33 a month if you pay on an annual basis.</p><h1>5. Don\u2019t Pay on an Annual Basis</h1><p>On the other hand, if the provider does not have a proven track record or you haven\u2019t used them for very long, do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> sign up for a year\u2019s service.&nbsp; Imagine you see a tempting discounted offer and jump in at $5/mo and pre-pay on a 12-months-for-10 deal, so your cost is $50, or $4.17 a month.&nbsp; Over the next couple months you experience frequent downtimes, network problems, and poor service, and to top if off the host refuses to refund your money.&nbsp; Now you need to go sign up with a more respectable host at perhaps $7.50 a month.&nbsp; But your real cost now is $11.67 a month because you have dead money tied up in a service you can\u2019t use.</p><h1>6. Go Global</h1><p>If you live in Chicago, it seems logical to start looking for a VPS in Chicago.&nbsp; For game servers where you\u2019re playing with local friends, this makes perfect sense.&nbsp; But if you\u2019re serving web pages, consider looking beyond your neighborhood.&nbsp; Not long ago I was looking for some shared hosting and saw a great offer on LEB.&nbsp; The provider hosts in London, UK, whereas I live in the Western US.&nbsp; However, what I was hosting was low-volume shared content.&nbsp; For the average visitor, a half-seconds\u2019 latency would make zero difference to their experience and the savings were significant.</p><h1>7. Use Affiliate Codes</h1><p>Many hosts have affiliate rewards programs, where if a new subscriber uses your affiliate code at the time of signup, you get a small credit.&nbsp; If you frequently participate on forums, refer friends, etc. then you should always share the signup link with your affiliate code included.&nbsp; Over time, you may earn a few free months of hosting with little effort on your part.</p><h1>8. Check LowEndBox Offers</h1><p>LowEndBox posts offers every week from hosts hungry for new customers.&nbsp; Virtual servers, shared hosting, dedicated servers, VPNs, and CDNs are all frequently featured.&nbsp; If you don\u2019t see anything in the current offerings, search the past postings.&nbsp; You can always reach out to a host with a pre-sales ticket to see if they\u2019ll honor an old offer or make you a new one.&nbsp; Hosts advertise in many places but LowEndBox should always be on your short list of places to check when you\u2019re looking with a budget.</p><h1>9. Check LowEndTalk Offers</h1><p><a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LowEndTalk</a> is our sister site and discussion forum.&nbsp; Some hosts post offers on LEB and LET, but some only post on LET.&nbsp; It\u2019s always worth checking LowEndTalk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/categories/offers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">offers</a> section.</p><h1>10. Wait for Black Friday</h1><p>\u201cBlack Friday\u201d is a retail event in the US and other countries held on the day after Thanksgiving in which stores put their wares on deep discount.&nbsp; The \u201cblack\u201d part of this comes from the tradition that retailers run at a loss all year long but starting on this day, their accounting moves from red (used to indicate losses) to black (profit).&nbsp; On <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LowEndTalk</a>, there is an annual tradition of a 24-hour thread where providers share fantastic deals.&nbsp; Often providers will release a limited stock for this thread, so it pays to get in early and watch the thread all day long.&nbsp; Just be careful not to buy too much!</p><h1>Bonus: Are You a Student?</h1><p>You can get $50 in hosting credit at DigitalOcean, sufficient to run a 1GB RAM VM for 10 months, for free as part of the <a href=\"https://education.github.com/pack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a> (which also comes with many other very nice freebies).&nbsp; DO also offers free credit to anyone with a 60-day limit, but if you\u2019re a student looking for a VM, the GitHub SDP is a better deal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ftop-ten-ways-to-save-on-vps-hosting-and-a-bonus-eleventh-way%2F&amp;t=Top%20Ten%20Ways%20to%20Save%20on%20VPS%20Hosting%20%28and%20a%20Bonus%20Eleventh%20Way%29\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top%20Ten%20Ways%20to%20Save%20on%20VPS%20Hosting%20%28and%20a%20Bonus%20Eleventh%20Way%29&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ftop-ten-ways-to-save-on-vps-hosting-and-a-bonus-eleventh-way%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ftop-ten-ways-to-save-on-vps-hosting-and-a-bonus-eleventh-way%2F&amp;title=Top%20Ten%20Ways%20to%20Save%20on%20VPS%20Hosting%20%28and%20a%20Bonus%20Eleventh%20Way%29&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">1</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/servermanias-new-public-cloud-now-open-for-business/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
