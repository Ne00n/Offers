I have seen many hosts open their business and advertise their cheap low end packages on WebHostingTalk, only to close their door 2 months afterwards. In most cases they\u2019ll just do a runner and leave their customers panicking trying to recover files. I have also trying to do some background check on the providers and make <em>caveat emptor</em> warnings if I suspect the provider is a little bit dodgy.</p><p>I have to say that a lot of investigation is based on \u201cgut feelings\u201d. Some just smells plain dodgy, but with some you need to do quite a bit of digging to reveal their shady past. After all you do not want to sign up a low end VPS package (and possibly pay a whole year of fee in full) and later on loss everything on it. What sort of investigation do you use to determine whether a provider is dodgy?</p><p>Some checks I use:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/blog/low-end-providers-please-keep-your-dns-up/\">Running both DNS on the same box</a>. Only incompetent sysadmins do that.</li><li>Domain WHOIS privacy turned on. Why, as a registered business, don\u2019t you want your customers/prospects to know who you are? I don\u2019t buy the \u201cprevent email address harvested\u201d excuse either, as a competent hosting provider would know how to do spam filtering.</li><li>Lack of proper SSL certificate on their WHMCS and control panel pages. That usually spells \u201crush job\u201d to me. SSL certificates can be had for $15/year &amp; gives your customers a lot more \u201ctrust\u201d.</li><li>Other posts on WHT \u2014 either those about this provider, or early posts made by the owner of the provider.</li></ul><p>Any other sanity checks you use to evaluate a low end provider?</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-do-you-tell-a-provider-is-dodgy%2F&amp;t=How%20Do%20You%20Tell%20a%20Provider%20is%20Dodgy%3F\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20Do%20You%20Tell%20a%20Provider%20is%20Dodgy%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-do-you-tell-a-provider-is-dodgy%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-do-you-tell-a-provider-is-dodgy%2F&amp;title=How%20Do%20You%20Tell%20a%20Provider%20is%20Dodgy%3F&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
