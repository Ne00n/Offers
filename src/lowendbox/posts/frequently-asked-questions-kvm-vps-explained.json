If you\u2019re looking to learn more beyond this article, we\u2019ve got plenty more <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/category/tutorials/\">tutorials</a> and <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-virtual-private-servers-explained/\">FAQ\u2019s</a> which are worthy of reading.</p><p><b>Question: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the difference between KVM and OpenVZ VPS?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, KVM provides dedicated resources, and allows you to run the VM independently (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with its own kernel, and operating system of your choice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). OpenVZ is typically more cost-effective, though it comes with limitations of its own nature, such as the inability to run Docker natively and sharing the same kernel as the hypervisor/host node. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently we\u2019ve highlighted some of the strengths of the </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/what-is-an-openvz-vps-what-are-the-benefits-and-why-you-want-one/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenVZ</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/what-is-a-kvm-vps-the-technology-explained/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KVM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> architecture. Additionally, at LowEndBox we ran a </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/poll-results-your-preferred-virtualization-engine/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the preferred virtualization engine that users prefer, and KVM came far ahead as the winner.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-23910\"></span></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Are KVM VPS instantly activated?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, most KVM VPS providers offer instant activation. If you are in a time-sensitive situation, feel free to check the provider\u2019s website before ordering to see if they advertise instant/automated provisioning.</span></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Why has KVM become such a popular virtualization technology?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past years, KVM has become an increasingly popular choice among both service providers and consumers. This is thanks to its stable virtualization technology which allows a VM to act independently as if it were its own dedicated server. Before KVM, users were typically restricted (by virtualization platforms such as OpenVZ and Virtuozzo) to certain OS\u2019s and certain kernel versions. As KVM based VPS\u2019s run independently, all of those restrictions are effectively removed, giving the consumer more control and power than ever available before within a virtualized environment.</span></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Can I run Windows OS on a KVM VPS?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, technically KVM virtualization platform supports Windows OS (or any OS, really!). Check with your provider before ordering to ensure they support/allow Windows OS to be run on their VPS platform.</span></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Can I run Docker on a KVM VPS?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, Docker is natively supported on a KVM VPS and can be run without having to worry about loading special modules on the host.</span></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What are some KVM VPS Providers?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LowEndBox recently compiled a list of the best and cheapest VPS providers (updated 2020). KVM VPS providers included: RackNerd, VirMach, ExtraVM, HudsonValleyHost, DediPath, LetBox, LosAngelesVPS, and RamNode. See: </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/best-cheap-vps-hosting-updated-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://lowendbox.com/best-cheap-vps-hosting-updated-2020/</span></a></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Can I install my own custom OS if I have an ISO?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, KVM VPS do have the ability to mount your own ISO to install your own operating system. The OS install is typically completed via a VNC or noVNC console. Be sure to contact your hosting provider before ordering to ensure they support the ability to mount custom ISO\u2019s.</span></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What is a KVM VPS?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A KVM VPS is a virtual private server that lives on a physical dedicated server \u2013 however the VPS operates as its own server. KVM VPS technology is typically more desirable compared to other technologies such as OpenVZ because KVM virtualization supports the ability to run custom OS, kernels, and more. A KVM VPS is very similar to having a dedicated server \u2013 offering tremendous reliability and performance at a fraction of the cost of a dedicated server. Most KVM VPS providers also include console access via VNC/noVNC, providing you with total control over your server\u2019s environment.</span></p><p><b>Question:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Can I upgrade my KVM VPS?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, the answer to this question is yes \u2013 the KVM platform is built to be scalable. However, this policy may vary from provider to provider, so check with your VPS provider on upgrade procedures/options before ordering.</span></p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ffrequently-asked-questions-kvm-vps-explained%2F&amp;t=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%3A%20KVM%20VPS%20Explained\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%3A%20KVM%20VPS%20Explained&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ffrequently-asked-questions-kvm-vps-explained%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ffrequently-asked-questions-kvm-vps-explained%2F&amp;title=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%3A%20KVM%20VPS%20Explained&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">2</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-windows-vps/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
