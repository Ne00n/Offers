Though some may have limited offers, but it all depends on your requirement.

It integrates with all the popular control panels and also provides extensive documentation about each module. Whether you sell hosting, domain, or SSL, it automates everything for you. Another good thing is that it has a large community and hence an extensive marketplace, you could ever find for hosting modules and plugins. With all the built-in modules and community modules, you can even provide other services along with your hosting business such as game servers, software and lots more depending on your customization level.</p><p>However, WHMCS uses IonCube to protect their code from getting stolen, which makes it hard to customize it as per user\u2019s need.</p><p>Pricing starts at $15.95/mo for 250 clients with a branding and self-hosted solution. If you are a corporation, then $39.95/mo for unlimited clients with non-branding.</p><p>If you provide web hosting, virtual private servers, SSL certificates, game servers, and other digital products, then WHMCS is a perfect platform for you.</p><p><a><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTUwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDE1MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hostbill-2019-theme-cloud-hosting.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"> </a><strong>HostBill</strong></p><p>Host Bill is a professional platform for hosting business, providing a vast number of features. Those who are looking to expand their business, can surely look into it and consider it. It has a nice functionality, especially for data centers and large-scale hosting business who provide dedicated servers. It is also mentioned on their web page that they have over five hundred integrations for control panels, applications, order templates, client templates, payment gateways and modules. Just like all other billing platforms, it comes with all basic features. They also provide good documentation, especially for developers.</p><p>Since Host Bill has numerous amounts of features, it has a price for it too, as it is an expensive billing platform. Price starts at $599 one-time payment with limited amount of integrations and is labeled as \u201cStartup\u201d, and it only allows creating ten support tickets. Every license also comes with 1 year of support and updates, which can be renewed optionally for $99/year. Host Bill also uses IonCube to protect their code from getting stolen, hence modification is not possible.</p><p>Host Bill is a great billing platform, but it comes at a greater price. Though, data centers and large-scale business can afford it easily, but smaller business cannot and can look for other alternatives.</p><p><a><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTUwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDE1MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wisecp-screen.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"> </a><strong>WISECP</strong></p><p>A new billing solution for hosting business, which has caught our attention. It ships with all the basic features required for small, medium and large hosting business, along with some distinctive features that can be found in other billing platforms, but at extra cost, we found that those features are part of WISECP core. Though integrations are quite limited, but considering the business age, there were more features than the one that are in the industry for more than ten years.</p><p>Some unique features such as a website integrated with client area and a document verification system, allows hosting companies to ask their clients for documents based on certain conditions. Domain Management is complete, providing you to apply price automatically based on registrar prices. Affiliate system is also built-in, allowing your business to expand. Another thing which we found amazing is that it is being updated frequently.</p><p>WISECP uses IonCube to protect their code, so customization is not easy. Documentations are not much in detail, so it is hard for developers to create a module.</p><p>Pricing starts at $12.90/mo with branded license and without any restrictions which is economical. Other options include the professional license for $295 one time with support &amp; upgrades renewing for $35 every year and an enterprise (lifetime) license which they sell for $695.</p><p>Since WISECP is light on pocket, it is good for all small, medium and large business who want to provide web hosting, virtual private servers, domains and SSL certificates.</p><p><a><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTUwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDE1MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/slide-billing-overview.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"> </a><strong>Blesta</strong></p><p>Blesta is an open-source and affordable hosting platform for web hosting business. The code is written efficiently, allowing developers to customize it as per their needs. Almost every basic feature is present in Blesta, however, it lacks a proper domain management system which is an essential part of web hosting business. They have a great and friendly community with Discord and forums which helps with the issues. The documentation is well-prepared and one can understand the system easily as it is made user-friendly.</p><p>It does not only limit you to provide hosting services, but downloadable products too. It also has a built-in integration for some well-known game control panels, allowing you to provide game servers with this platform. As of July 29, 2020 Blesta released an update that includes a built-in affiliate system. Blesta generally has a fewer amount of integrations as compared to other billing platforms, though their frequent software updates are cause for confidence.</p><p>Blesta starts at $12.95/mo with branded license and does not have any restrictions. It also provides an owned license, which starts at $250 one-time payment and one year of support and updates. Support and updates can be renewed for $39/year. Many well-known companies provide Blesta for free with their services, so you can also get Blesta along with their services.</p><p>It is an affordable hosting platform, which is good for small to medium-sized business and are looking to provide web hosting, virtual private servers and game servers hosting.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbilling-software-platforms-for-your-hosting-business-compared%2F&amp;t=Billing%20Software%2FPlatforms%20for%20Your%20Hosting%20Business%20Compared\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Billing%20Software%2FPlatforms%20for%20Your%20Hosting%20Business%20Compared&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbilling-software-platforms-for-your-hosting-business-compared%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbilling-software-platforms-for-your-hosting-business-compared%2F&amp;title=Billing%20Software%2FPlatforms%20for%20Your%20Hosting%20Business%20Compared&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">4</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/managing-your-lowendempire-with-ansible-part-1/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
