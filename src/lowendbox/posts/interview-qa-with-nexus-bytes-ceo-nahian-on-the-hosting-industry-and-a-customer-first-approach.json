So let\u2019s get started with the interview!</span></p><p><strong>What can you tell us about yourself, how you got to where you are today, and your role at your company?</strong></p><p>I am a life long retailer. I have owned and operated multiple successful chain retail stores across 6 different states in between 2010-2018. In mid 2018, I have sold all of my retail businesses so I could spending quality time with my friends and family and focus on self improvement. I currently work as a franchise consultant and a regional Sales Director for a major national telecommunication company. I have been in the hosting world since early 2008, used to own and operate HostCell.net, a pretty famous free post2host web hosting site back in the days. In 2011, I partnered with one of my cousins and together, we re branded and created Ninja Hawk. After successfully operating under the new brand for 2 more years, due to internal conflicts, the brand was sold to TMZ VPS and I for one took some time off the internet and focused on growing my retail presence.</p><p>However, being a lifetime geek, my passion for hosting industry never died. In 2016, I opened my last retail location in Hartford Connecticut and after successfully launching the last location, I wanted to do something slightly different that would make my inner geek happy and mid 2016, Nexus Bytes LLC was born. Nexus Bytes initially catered towards local accounting and retail businesses in CT and NY, where we offered and provided hosting and IT infrastructure and powered multiple local small brands and family owned businesses.</p><p>In 2018, when I sold all my businesses, I wanted to do something more with my free time and launched ServedEZ, a no frill free web hosting service by Nexus Bytes LLC. It was created as a charity project, to offer something back to the internet community, providing an easy startup ground for those, who needs a safe and secure place to host their website/projects and are not able to pay.</p><p>In mid 2019, I wanted to do a little bit more. Being a life time entrepreneur, I realized that it was time take Nexus Bytes to the next level and expand our range of services to a global audience, that would complement our ServedEZ brand. While it might look like an One man show, I have dear friend, who assists from time to time and fills in when I am out/not available, to ensure that our family members (Customers) are never left unattended.</p><p><span id=\"more-22186\"></span></p><p><strong>What is the most significant characteristic that makes your company unique in today\u2019s evolving market landscape?</strong></p><p>I have built my businesses (retail and online), with 2 key things in mind,</p><p>-Customer first<br>\nI and we (Nexus Bytes LLC) call our customers, family members. Because, family comes first and so does our customers. We focus on ensuring that our customers are satisfied, by not only offering them a steady service, but also treating every one with kindness and respect. We go above and beyond to ensure that our family members are happy and getting the best value for their money.</p><p>While we are a business, we are also consumers our self and we want to offer everything that we would expect our vendors to offer us, in terms of customer service and solving solution. Which is by not just responding quickly using scripted responses, but actually reading and understanding clients request, analyzing their requirement and honestly responding to their inquiries with personal touch.</p><p>We offer exclusive \u201c<a href=\"https://nexusbytes.com/knowledgebase/38/Family-Perks---Because-family-matters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Family Perks</a>\u201d&nbsp;to our existing family members. We will continue to add more to the list as we has out some details&nbsp;<img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/wink.png\" class=\"emoji litespeed-loaded\" title=\";)\" data-src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/wink.png\" alt=\";)\" height=\"20\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></p><p>-Cutting edge technology and a promise to evolve with time.</p><p>We understand the need for not just being stable, but also fast and steady! We are one of the first host in the LE community to offer performance packed, Ryzen powered VPS\u2019s and we continue to offer them out of all 4 locations we operate in (NYC Metro, Miami, Florida, LA, California and FSN, Germany :&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nexusbytes.com/network.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://nexusbytes.com/network.html</a>&nbsp;). We will continue to evaluate new technologies and introduce them to our family members, as we see them fit&nbsp;<img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" class=\"emoji litespeed-loaded\" title=\":)\" data-src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" alt=\":)\" height=\"20\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></p><p>We understand that money doesn\u2019t grow on tree and we will ensure the money you are spending with us, is not just a spending but a proper investment for you budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why should customers trust you and your business?</strong></p><p>I am extremely real and approachable and always make my self available to my existing and potential clients. I will not start by saying the cookie cutter, \u201cWe saw a void and we are here to fill it spray foam.\u201d Our goal is not to become the biggest hosting provider out there. We are here to set the gold standard of web hosting customer service. We stand by our no question asked money back policy and welcome every one to try us out.</p><p>We do not compete with pricing. Though, we are extremely well known for offering some insane deals here and there, we are not the \u201cCheapest\u201d by we are definitely affordable and quality is something, that we do not compromise on! We do not over subscribe more than what we can offer and we are extremely transparent. When you want best bang for your bucks, you should Join Nexus Bytes \u2013 Affordable boutique servers, priceless bespoke experience. Your Web Hosting Partner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to business owners today, or those aspiring to become one?</strong></p><p>Always remember where you came from. Stay close to your root. Always remember how it felt when you had your first signup and how you treated your first 10 customers, when you were a no name brand. Be humble. While you might be good, but there will always be someone, who is better than you. Treat others, how you want to be treated.</p><p>Keep an open mind. Ask for feedback, listen to those feedback and don\u2019t be defensive. Don\u2019t be cocky and be respectful, not only to your customers, but to your peers, to other businesses. Remain professional, remain calm and be transparent. Tough times will come and you might feel like things aren\u2019t going as you have anticipated. Do not freak out. Try to be creative and focus on keeping your heads up.</p><p>Never compete with price. You can\u2019t compete with someone with deep pocket, neither can you compete with someone, who is here to make quick cash, default on their invoice and deadpool after couple of months. Focus on building a brand, money will follow.</p><p>You will make mistakes. Those mistakes won\u2019t make you a bad person or a bad business. However, not learning from those mistakes, will. Tough times will come! It is just a matter of when. Be prepared for the worse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Would you recommend the hosting industry as a source of opportunity for entrepreneurs?</b></p><p>It is a tough industry and one, that is over saturated. But at the same time, there\u2019s always room for some one new. As long as you are offering something, that is unique enough to add additional value. Don\u2019t be a themeforest template, with a whmcs/blesta installation and a paypal account.</p><p>Open your notebook and calculator. Make notes. Do your math properly. Can you survive 1 year, with 0 customers and no incoming revenue? If the answer is yes, go for it. If the answer is no, you are not ready. There is nothing in between.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>What do you enjoy most about your role?</b></p><p>It is exciting. Keeps my mind active. I enjoy and admire the love I get from my Nexus Bytes Family members. It is your love and care, that makes the brand continue to grow!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>What do you find most difficult?</b></p><p>Customers, who drives a hard bargain. I am all for offering a good deal. However, asking multiple times, to price match or lower the price, when I/we made it completely clear that we can\u2019t do such. We will work with any existing and potential client, within our limits, however, at the same time, we expect the person on the other side to work with us as well&nbsp;<img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" class=\"emoji\" title=\":)\" data-src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" alt=\":)\" height=\"20\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Both personally and professionally, what guiding principles ground you?</strong></p><p>I live by two sayings,</p><p>\u201cIt takes two hand to clap, but one to slap\u201d<br>\n\u201cToday is what we have, now is where we are. Lets make today the best day of our life and now the best time\u201d</p><p>I was raised in an environment, where I was taught to be honest, humble and respectful. And I will never forget that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell me about some of the new and exciting things you are working on at your company?</strong></p><p>It won\u2019t be fun if I spill all the beans now&nbsp;<img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" class=\"emoji\" title=\";)\" data-src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/wink.png\" alt=\";)\" height=\"20\">. We continue to analyze our business and market needs and we will continue to bring retail styled fun elements to make \u201cWeb Hosting Great Again\u201d</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final thoughts and anything you would like to add?</strong></p><p>I hope and pray that the Covid-19 crisis is over soon enough and I wish everyone that is reading this a happy and prosperous life and the same to your loved ones.</p><p>We, Nexus Bytes LLC, thank you, the community, for continuing to support us and showering us with your love and blessings.
