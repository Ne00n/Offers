I\u2019m back from my \u201cshort break\u201d and decided to finish up my last month\u2019s Dead Pool post. I have been writing my monthly dead pool provider list <a href=\"/blog/lowendbox-dead-pool-april-2010/\">since May last year</a>, and all I have experienced is that the list just gets longer and wackier. As usual, the list has already been discussed <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/751/dead-pool-november-2011-discussion/p1\">on this thread on LowEndTalk</a>. Here we go.</p><h3>CPanelHost.me <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/cpanelhost.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"cPanelHost\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: CPanel Account Suspended Page</p><p>I first listed <a href=\"/blog/cpanelhost-me-5-512mb-openvz-vps/\">CPanelHost.me more than 2 years ago</a> when they were reselling BurstNET\u2019s 512MB Linux VPS product for $5/month (listing BurstNET\u2019s resellers is something that I no longer do here however). Somehow a keyboard duet erupted between \u201cMike Miller\u201d of CpanelHost and \u201cRobert\u201d in the comments, which got escalated to <a href=\"/blog/cpanelhost-me-5-512mb-openvz-vps/#comment-2115\">potential legal threat</a> against LowEndBox.com. That\u2019s indeed a sure way to never get listed again on LowEndBox.</p><p>It appears that the whole business died sometime in 2010, as there does not seem to be any activity on WHT. Domain now owned by Russell of WebRulon/AlienVPS.</p><p><span id=\"more-2286\"></span></p><h3>eNetSouth <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/enetsouth.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"eNetSouth\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP address not resolvable</p><p>I guess most people here would have known the story. I listed <a href=\"/blog/ens-cloud-5-99-256mb-vmware-vps/\">eNetSouth Cloud\u2019s WHT offer here</a> back in July 2010. A nice deal \u2014 $5.99 256MB VMWare VPS in Chicago on some premium hardware. Brandon has since been providing the LowEndBox community some exclusive offers on their VMWare platform, and <a href=\"/blog/lowendtalk-com-is-live-at-enetsouth-cloud/\">offered to host LowEndTalk community</a> a few months later. Earlier this year Brandon launched <a href=\"/blog/enetsouth-512mb-openvz-chicago/\">eNetSouth site</a> for SolusVM-based OpenVZ/KVM hosting. Finally in October he offered <a href=\"/blog/enetsouth-7-2gb-openvz-vps-in-san-jose/\">this too good to be true deal</a>, which sparked the collapse of his VPS hosting business. A month later, and they were gone \u2014 leaving many customers VPS-less.</p><p>I won\u2019t go down to more details on what has been going on, except to confirm that Brandon has indeed done a runner.</p><h3>HostMonkey <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/hostmonkey.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"HostMonkey\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: CPanel Account Suspended</p><p><a href=\"/blog/hostmonkey-5-128mb-openvz-vps/\">HostMonkey</a> was first listed on LowEndBox in August 2010 by the same guy who <a href=\"/blog/nixism-5-128mb-openvz-vps/\">ran a dead pool host before</a>. A few days later <a href=\"/blog/hostmonkey-5-256mb-openvz-vps-exclusive-offer/\">they offered an exclusive offer for LEB community</a>, and <a href=\"/blog/hostmonkey-5-256mb-openvz-vps-exclusive-offer/#comment-12333\">2 months later business sold</a> to webRulon. Like CPanelHost, its website was also turned off last month.</p><h3>MountSpot <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/mountspot.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"MountSpot\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP address not resolvable</p><p>When <a href=\"/tag/mountspot-com/\">MountSpot</a> was <a href=\"/blog/mountspot-6-59-512mb-openvz-vps-in-india/\">first listed here in August</a>, it was targeting an interesting niche \u2014 low cost VPS in the South Asia region where there is no other competition at this price range. I guess now it\u2019s obvious that they were competitor-less because they were just not sustainable. They were <a href=\"https://flippa.com/2668729-3000-revenue-web-hosting-business-in-top-market-reputed-business\">listed for sale on Flippa</a>, but don\u2019t think they have sold it as WHOIS is still pointing to their Hong Kong-registered business.</p><h3>Nixhost <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/nixhost.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"Nixhost\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: 502 Bad Gateway</p><p><a href=\"/blog/nixhost-6-384mb-kvm-vps-in-france/\">Nixhost.co.uk was first listed here</a> merely 4 months ago, and when questioned about legitimacy, Ben <a href=\"/blog/nixhost-6-384mb-kvm-vps-in-france/#comment-41597\">assured us</a> that they <em>\u201care not going down the drain\u201d</em>. 3 months later and they are dead, with CloudFlare showing gateway error (i.e. the actual box hosting the website is no longer up). Sometimes you gotta love how quickly the LowEndBox community can kill a hosting business.</p><h3>PrestonHost <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/prestonhost.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"PrestonHost\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Redirecting to <a href=\"http://www.bigbrainhost.com/\">BigBrainHost</a></p><p>LowEndBox first listed Singapore based <a href=\"/blog/prestonhost-5-50-512mb-openvz-vps/\">PrestonHost</a> in May 2010, and it appears Faris had <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1097777\">sold the business to BigBrainHost</a> last month. Looking at how well Brian has been running BBH these days it might be a good news to all the PrestonHost customers.</p><h3>SlickWebHost <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/slickwebhost.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"SlickWebHost\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP address not resolvable</p><p><a href=\"/blog/slickwebhost-5-53-256mb-openvz-vps-in-scranton/\">SlickWebHost</a> first emailed me in May to have their OpenVZ plan listed, Their servers got suspended by their provider (HostNOC) in November due to abuse, as <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1097787&amp;page=2#post7810258\">reported by the admin</a> \u201cClaudiu Amarandei\u201d. They can\u2019t afford to bring the servers back up and have decided to end the services there.</p><h3>UptimeVPS.co <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/uptimevps2.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"UptimeVPS\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP address not resolvable</p><p>Ken from <a href=\"/blog/uptimevps-e1-50-128mb-xen-vps-in-france/\">UptimeVPS</a> emailed me in August to list their Xen VPS plan. Problem started right from the beginning when he could not resolve the routing issue. They then moved to offer OpenVZ services instead with very cheap annual plans and <a href=\"/blog/uptimevps-e3-1gb-openvz-vps-in-scranton-france-or-germany/\">3 EUR 1GB plan</a>. Issues started happening in October (which Ken claimed <a href=\"/blog/uptimevps-e3-1gb-openvz-vps-in-scranton-france-or-germany/#comment-50056\">fraud as the culprit</a>) but things quickly gone downhill in November. Their domain, \u201cuptimevps.co\u201d stopped resolving on 14 Nov and that spelt the end of it.</p><h3>Vazapi <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/vazapi.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"Vazapi\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: AdSense for Domain</p><p><a href=\"/tag/vazapi-com/\">Vazapi</a> was the new venture from the ServerMinds/Graxis in 2011 (after they sold BuzzServers and Zabogo, both were also featured on LowEndBox in previous years). Not surprisingly it also faced the same fate, as Vazapi got <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/questions/12109/wth-vazapi-gone-forever/13916\">sold to Netrouting in July 2011</a>, and all servers migrated by August. I guess Netrouting has just turned off the hosting for the website in November, and it\u2019s now parked on AdSense.</p><h3>VPSBB <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/vpsbb.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"VPSBB\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Website not connecting</p><p><a href=\"/blog/vpsbb-4-95-128mb-openvz-vps/\">VPSBB</a> was 123Systems\u2019 attempt on offering simple minimalistic VPS plan on a simple minimalistic website. 123Systems is still kicking, but VPSBB website was down since 14 November. Andrew has <a href=\"/blog/dead-pool-august-2010/#comment-8857\">forgot to transfer the hosting</a> once last year so I am not surprised that he might have fotgotten again this year. There\u2019s probably no point of having a separate brand anyway.</p><h3>VPSCheap.info <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/vpscheap.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"VPSCheap.info\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP address not resolvable</p><p><a href=\"/blog/vpscheap-1-50-128mb-openvz-vps-in-scranton-or-phoenix/\">VPSCheap.info</a> was first listed in September offering $1.50/month VPS in Scranton or Phoenix. They had a rough ride right from the beginning with services going up and down. They finally did a runner at the end of October, and their domain stopped resolving in November. Well, Erez still runs <a href=\"/blog/cheapdomainnamesdot-com-4-99-512mb-openvz-vps-in-phoenix/\">CheapDomainNameDot.com</a> and the website is still up there. Not for long I guess.</p><h3>ZazoomVPS <img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/zazoomvps.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"ZazoomVPS\"></h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Website timeout</p><p>Daniel first got me to list his <a href=\"/blog/zazoomvps-7-512mb-kvm-vps-in-scranton/\">ZazoomVPS</a> hosting service in June offering KVM on SolusVM, and <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/278/zazoomvps-being-sold/p1\">by the time it got sold</a> in September it has got some pretty happy clients. Daniel decided to move on to get into tertiary education, however it seems he had <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/16774#Comment_16774\">sold the business to the wrong person</a> as neither the website nor the VPS host nodes have their bills paid for.</p><h3>Upcoming\u2026</h3><p>These are the hosting providers who are currently marked as down at the moment.
