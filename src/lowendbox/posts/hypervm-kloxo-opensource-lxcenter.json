Their future were cloudy back then, but it appears that there is at least some hope.</p><p>Today I received an email from Arthur Thornton from <a href=\"http://lxcenter.org/\">LxCenter</a>, the new home for the now-open-sourced HyperVM and Kloxo.</p><blockquote><p>They (HyperVM and Kloxo) will be open sourced when we release the vulnerability fix versions of both panels and we will continue to support them from then on.</p><p>The reason I want you to post this is because your site seems to be popular and I think there are many people still worried about the products and this could reassure them.</p><p>Another note is that they will be free to use completely. But the most important part is that they will live on, most likely in an AGPL license (off the record), rather than dying with Ligesh.</p></blockquote><p>Sounds like a <b>great</b> news to me. For the last month and half, the VPS scene has been hectic. Tons of half-baked control panel programmes flooded the market, and there are some open sourced ones trying to grab some shares as well. Although I doubt any is offering the functionality of HyperVM at its price point (otherwise it would be a clear winner by now). It is also a time to find out which hosts are one-man show and which ones are capable \u2014 from their strategies in developing custom in-house panel, or in migrating customers to new backend, etc.</p><p>Also note the clever choice of <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html\">AGPL</a> which means those made customisations/enhancements and then deploy them onto public network must also contribute back. That would only mean good things to the community.</p><p>Well. I guess we just have to wait to find out.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fhypervm-kloxo-opensource-lxcenter%2F&amp;t=HyperVM%20and%20Kloxo%20Now%20Open%20Sourced%2C%20Hosted%20at%20LxCenter\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HyperVM%20and%20Kloxo%20Now%20Open%20Sourced%2C%20Hosted%20at%20LxCenter&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fhypervm-kloxo-opensource-lxcenter%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fhypervm-kloxo-opensource-lxcenter%2F&amp;title=HyperVM%20and%20Kloxo%20Now%20Open%20Sourced%2C%20Hosted%20at%20LxCenter&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/rip-kt-ligesh-of-lxlabs/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"RIP KT Ligesh of LxLabs\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/leb-centered-small.jpg) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">RIP KT Ligesh of LxLabs</div></div></a></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
