Let\u2019s run a <b>COMPETITION</b>!</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>Build the <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/\"><b>LowEndTalk.com</b></a> community. Many useful questions have been asked over the past few weeks and I have learned a lot from the answers you guys provided. Keep it up! So one thing I would like to do is to continue building this community and make it more lively.</p><h3>Competition Criteria</h3><p>Currently each person is given a \u201ckarma score\u201d on LowEndTalk \u2014 it should be shown next to your username. On <b>Thursday 23 December 2010</b> at <b>12AM UTC</b> I would like to pick <b>3 winners</b> that have the most karma score on LowEndTalk, excluding myself.</p><p>Here is a <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/users/\">list of users</a> sorted by their karma. If I need to pick the winners today it would be spindritf, rm_ and drmike.</p><h3>Prizes</h3><p>For the 3 winners, each can choose a low end VPS package from <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/questions/64/low-end-vps-rankingrating-for-2010-q4\">any of the top 3 providers of 2010 Q4</a>. For example right now a winner can choose from either QuickWeb, RamHost or BuyVM. I will pay a yearly package for you, i.e. up to the value of USD$84/year.</p><h3>Rules &amp; Conditions</h3><p>Well. At the end LowEndTalk.com is where people ask questions and share knowledges. So please DO NOT game the system to get high karma. Instead, ask sound questions, or provide good answers, or give constructive comments.</p><p>For example, linking to pr0n site might get you a lot of votes with this male-dominated community, but is definitely a NO in building this community up :) I\u2019ll audit the winners when I come back.</p><p>All clear? I still have a few hours to answer questions. Otherwise have fun and see ya in 2 weeks.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Foh-wait-one-more-thing-lowendtalk-competition%2F&amp;t=Oh%20Wait%2C%20One%20More%20Thing...%20LowEndTalk%20Competition%21\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Oh%20Wait%2C%20One%20More%20Thing...%20LowEndTalk%20Competition%21&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Foh-wait-one-more-thing-lowendtalk-competition%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Foh-wait-one-more-thing-lowendtalk-competition%2F&amp;title=Oh%20Wait%2C%20One%20More%20Thing...%20LowEndTalk%20Competition%21&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
