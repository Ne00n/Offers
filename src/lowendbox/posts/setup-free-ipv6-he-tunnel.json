While this is a nice solution, it still requires the customer to fix something that should have been done by the provider. So, I thought, let\u2019s write a tutorial for providers how to fix this for the customer.</p><p>In this tutorial I will show you how to set up a bridged network interface and radvd to get the VPS on a host IPv6 connected. After that, you can route /64 blocks to individual VPS. By using the routed /48 you can get from HE, you can assign up to 65535 /64 blocks to your customers (the other one is used for SLAAC and routing). What\u2019s better than to promise a customer 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 IPv6 addresses for _free_ and all the while being ready for the future of the internet?!</p><p><span id=\"more-4016\"></span></p><p>I\u2019ve tested this tutorial on a Xen hosts with Xen PV guests. The Xen host was a KVM machine. The Xen host was running the latest LTS of Ubuntu (12.04), 64-bit. I assume you\u2019ve set up a HE IPv6 tunnel, according to <a title=\"IPv6 with a Hurricane Electric tunnel\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/ipv6-with-a-hurricane-electric-tunnel/\">my guide</a> (you can request the free, routed /48 from the tunnel overview page at HE). You also need at least one VPS that uses the network bridge. For KVM and Xen, this is usually the case. For OpenVZ you should have set this up if you\u2019re using veth networking.</p><p><em>Editorial note: I\u2019m writing this tutorial for Ubuntu. Next week I will write the one for CentOS. Due to how different these two \u201ctypes\u201d of distributions work, I found it harder to combine this subject into one guide, as it covers multiple topics.<br>\n</em></p><h2>Bridged network interface and the /48</h2><p>First thing to do, if you haven\u2019t already, is create a network bridge for your VPS. In my case, I called it xenbr0 as it\u2019s a bridge for Xen. Open up the /etc/network/interfaces file and add the following to it:</p><blockquote><p># Xen bridge<br>\nauto xenbr0<br>\niface xenbr0 inet static<br>\naddress 198.51.100.150<br>\nnetmask 255.255.255.192<br>\ngateway 198.51.100.129<br>\nbridge_ports eth0</p></blockquote><p>What we\u2019ve done here, is create a network bridge with as port eth0. This means that this virtual network interface moves all traffic over the physical eth0 device (which is in this case virtualized as I am doing this on a KVM). If you have more physical network ports, you can add them here and basically traffic will go over them as well (without getting into details).</p><p>We\u2019ve also configured the IPv4 address of eth0 under xenbr0. This bridge will, from now on, act as your primary network interface. This means that the current eth0 configuration is not needed any more. Change the eth0 config to the following:</p><blockquote><p># The primary network interface<br>\nauto eth0<br>\niface eth0 inet manual</p></blockquote><p>This will ensure eth0 configuration is left to the bridge interface. Now either reboot or \u201crestart\u201d the interfaces:</p><blockquote><p>sudo ifdown eth0 &amp;&amp; sudo ifup eth0 &amp;&amp; sudo ifup xenbr0</p></blockquote><p>If you now run \u2018ifconfig\u2019, it should be different from before and look like this (this includes the HE IPv6 tunnel, I\u2019ve skipped other devices):</p><blockquote><p>eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:16:3c:6e:ae:42<br>\ninet6 addr: fe80::216:3cff:fe6e:ae42/64 Scope:Link<br>\nUP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1<br>\nRX packets:742142 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0<br>\nTX packets:303359 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0<br>\ncollisions:0 txqueuelen:1000<br>\nRX bytes:141084239 (141.0 MB) TX bytes:66993159 (66.9 MB)</p><p>he-ipv6 Link encap:IPv6-in-IPv4<br>\ninet6 addr: 2001:db8:1f0a:3ec::2/64 Scope:Global<br>\nUP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MTU:1480 Metric:1<br>\nRX packets:65958 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0<br>\nTX packets:38902 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0<br>\ncollisions:0 txqueuelen:0<br>\nRX bytes:83514750 (83.5 MB) TX bytes:3924142 (3.9 MB)</p><p>xenbr0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:16:3c:6e:ae:42<br>\ninet addr:198.51.100.150 Bcast:198.51.100.191 Mask:255.255.255.192<br>\ninet6 addr: fe80::216:3cff:fe6e:ae42/64 Scope:Link<br>\nUP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1<br>\nRX packets:390266 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0<br>\nTX packets:210857 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0<br>\ncollisions:0 txqueuelen:0<br>\nRX bytes:110188811 (110.1 MB) TX bytes:48526200 (48.5 MB)</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s all for the bridge for now. We\u2019ll return to it later to add some routing configuration.</p><p>Next, we need to make the sure /48 you got from HE is routed properly on your host, so we can use one of the /64 blocks from it for radvd. The /48 is routed against your Client IPv6 Address, which ends with ::2. You also have a routed /64 available, which is routed the same way as the /48, but we do want to use the /48 here so you can assign /64-blocks to individual VPS.</p><p>We need to add the following lines to the he-ipv6 device in /etc/network/interfaces:</p><blockquote><p>up ip -6 route add 2001:db8:1f0a::/48 dev xenbr0<br>\ndown ip -6 route del 2001:db8:1f0a::/48 dev xenbr0</p></blockquote><p>These lines tell Ubuntu to route the entire 2001:db8:1f0a::/48 address range over device xenbr0, the one we\u2019ve just set up, when the he-ipv6 interface comes up. It also removes the route again when the he-ipv6 interface goes down.</p><p>Your final he-ipv6 configuration should look like this:</p><blockquote><p># HE IPv6 tunnel<br>\nauto he-ipv6<br>\niface he-ipv6 inet6 v4tunnel<br>\nendpoint 216.66.22.2<br>\naddress 2001:db8:1f0a:3ec::2<br>\nnetmask 64<br>\nup ip -6 route add default dev he-ipv6<br>\nup ip -6 route add 2001:db8:1f0a::/48 dev xenbr0<br>\ndown ip -6 route del 2001:db8:1f0a::/48 dev xenbr0<br>\ndown ip -6 route del default dev he-ipv6</p></blockquote><p>Now let\u2019s get started on getting your VPS initial IPv6 connection!</p><h2>radvd</h2><p>radvd is an IPv6 Router Advertisement Daemon. It responds to router solicitation queries that hosts send when trying to configure IPv6. radvd answers with a router advertisement message. Router solicitation and advertisement are part of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol that (amongst other things) facilitates Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC). It makes sure the host has the \u201cupper\u201d 64 bits of the IPv6 address. The \u201clower\u201d 64 bits are generated and based upon the MAC address of the host\u2019s network interface for which the IPv6 address is requested.</p><p>We\u2019re going to set up radvd to respond to solicitation queries and provide the upper 64 bits of the IPv6 address to the VPS. From that moment on, the VPS are IPv6 connected. The complete address that results from that process is then going to be used to route a /64 against.</p><p>Install radvd first:</p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install radvd</p></blockquote><p>Open up /etc/radvd.conf (this file usually doesn\u2019t exist yet) and past the following into it:</p><blockquote><p>interface xenbr0<br>\n{<br>\nAdvSendAdvert on;<br>\nprefix 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff::/64<br>\n{<br>\nAdvOnLink on;<br>\nAdvAutonomous on;<br>\n};<br>\n};</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019ll go through this line-by-line.</p><blockquote><p>interface xenbr0</p></blockquote><p>This defines on which interface radvd is active. In this case it is our network bridge which we just added. The following configuration block (in between the curly braces) is applied to that interface.</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;AdvSendAdvert on;</p></blockquote><p>This tells radvd to send router advertisement messages, either in response to a router solicitation query or periodically to announce its presence.</p><blockquote><p>prefix 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff::/64</p></blockquote><p>This is a very important line. This is a /64 we\u2019ve taken from the /48 we got from HE. I\u2019ve chosen to use \u2018ffff\u2019, the \u201chighest\u201d possible \u201cnumber\u201d in the range (from \u20180000\u2019 to \u2018ffff\u2019). This /64 is used as an address prefix for your VPS (the upper 64 bits). You could choose another one here, of course. But since we\u2019re going to be assigning /64-blocks, we might as well start with \u20181\u2019 there (2001:db8:1f0a:1::/64, 2001:db8:1f0a:2::/64 and so on).</p><p>Next, there are the two last options:</p><blockquote><p>AdvOnLink on;<br>\nAdvAutonomous on;</p></blockquote><p>\u2018AdvOnLink\u2019 makes sure you are responding to solicitation requests only on the interface you\u2019ve just specified. \u2018AvdAutonomous\u2019 tells radvd that SLAAC should be allowed.</p><p>Now we\u2019ve got radvd configured, restart it:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;sudo service radvd restart</p></blockquote><p>If you now reboot any of your VPS, they should be handed an IPv6 address! That address should work out of the box on an Ubuntu VPS.</p><h2>Routing /64-blocks</h2><p>The final part is actually routing /64 address blocks to your VPS. For this process, you need to know the IPv6 address of the virtual machine you\u2019re going to route the /64 to. This is the address the VPS got from radvd. For the address to be active, the VPS will have to be rebooted (or it\u2019s networking interface restarted).</p><p>Now, the next step is a bit dependent upon your situation. I\u2019ve done this on a Xen host, so I had to do the following to obtain the SLAAC-obtained IPv6 address of my Xen domU. For other virtualization types, it may be different. I listed my domU\u2019s network information with:</p><blockquote><p>sudo xm network-list ubuntu</p></blockquote><p>This will output something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Idx BE MAC Addr. handle state evt-ch tx-/rx-ring-ref BE-path<br>\n0 0 00:16:3e:72:39:de 0 4 10 768 /769 /local/domain/0/backend/vif/8/0</p></blockquote><p>The MAC address is what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m going to use the MAC address to calculate the lower 64 bits, so I can create the full address and use that for routing. I\u2019ve used this calculator: <a href=\"http://silmor.de/ipaddrcalc.html#ip6\">http://silmor.de/ipaddrcalc.html#ip6</a>. I put in the 48 bit MAC and converted that to a Host ID:</p><blockquote><p>MAC: 00:16:3e:72:39:de<br>\nHost ID: ::216:3eff:fe72:39de</p></blockquote><p>If I combine that Host ID with the prefix from radvd, I get the following IPv6 address:</p><blockquote><p>2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de</p></blockquote><p>Which is the IPv6 address of the virtual machine you\u2019re going to route the /64 to. Try pinging the address to see if it works:</p><blockquote><p>mpkossen@xen01:~$ ping6 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de<br>\nPING 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de(2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de) 56 data bytes<br>\n64 bytes from 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.509 ms<br>\n64 bytes from 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.314 ms<br>\n64 bytes from 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.374 ms<br>\n64 bytes from 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.388 ms<br>\n\u2014&nbsp;2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de ping statistics \u2014<br>\n4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 2999ms<br>\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.314/0.396/0.509/0.072 ms<br>\nmpkossen@xen01:~$</p></blockquote><p>Of course, when the MAC address changes, the SLAAC-obtained IP address changes. So make sure the VPS always has the same MAC address. We could have entered the VPS, of course, but I assumed you couldn\u2019t and still wanted to get the SLAAC-obtained IPv6 address.</p><p>Now, with that address, we can route a /64 to the virtual machine. On your host, add the following line to the xenbr0 block in /etc/network/interfaces:</p><blockquote><p>up ip -6 r a 2001:db8:1f0a:1::1/64 via&nbsp;2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de dev xenbr0</p></blockquote><p>So it looks like this:</p><blockquote><p># Xen bridge<br>\nauto xenbr0<br>\niface xenbr0 inet static<br>\naddress 198.51.100.150<br>\nnetmask 255.255.255.192<br>\ngateway 198.51.100.129<br>\nbridge_ports eth0<br>\nup ip -6 r a 2001:db8:1f0a:1::1/64 via&nbsp;2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de dev xenbr0</p></blockquote><p>What we\u2019ve done here, is route the 2001:db8:1f0a:1::/64 via the SLAAC-obtained address 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de on device xenbr0. You should also add the route manually once, so you don\u2019t need to restart your network interface to get it up:</p><blockquote><p>sudo ip -6 r a 2001:db8:1f0a:1::1/64 via&nbsp;2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de dev xenbr0</p></blockquote><p>From this moment on, all traffic to the 2001:db8:1f0a:1::/64 will be sent to your VPS. Your VPS still needs to handle traffic, though. On the guest, an IPv6 from the /64 needs to be configured and routed.</p><p>So let\u2019s do that. Inside the VPS, run the following two commands (or put them in a wiki for your customers):</p><blockquote><p>sudo ip -6 address add 2001:db8:1f0a:1::1/64 dev eth0<br>\nsudo ip -6 route add default via 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff::1 src 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de</p></blockquote><p>The first line adds and IP address to eth0, in this case the first address from the routed /64. The second line adds a default route for IPv6 traffic. It routes it via the gateway address of radvd and uses the SLAAC-obtained address to get there.</p><p>You should configure the address and add the last line to the network configuration of your VPS, to ensure the address and route are still there after a reboot:</p><blockquote><p>auto eth0<br>\niface eth0 inet6 static<br>\naddress 2001:db8:1f0a:1::1<br>\nnetmask 64<br>\ngateway 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff::1<br>\nup ip -6 route add default via 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff::1 src 2001:db8:1f0a:ffff:216:3eff:fe72:39de</p></blockquote><p>And you\u2019re done! Congratulations, it was a long run!</p><h2>Final notes</h2><p>While the above is a great solution for customers to get IPv6 connectivity (even if it is without the /64), it does require both work and knowledge from the provider. SolusVM is probably not going to help you with this, because of the way they\u2019ve implemented IPv6. This is thus something the provider should do manually (could be automated a bit by scripting some parts of it). However, it is, in my humble opinion, important to have IPv6 and it would really add value to your customers.</p><p>Besides, it\u2019s really cool if you get this setup working! It becomes easier to take a large KVM, load an OpenVZ or Xen kernel on it and create a large number of IPv6-only machines!</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fsetup-free-ipv6-he-tunnel%2F&amp;t=How%20to%20Setup%20An%20HE%20Tunnel%20to%20VPS%20%28Ubuntu%20Host%29\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20to%20Setup%20An%20HE%20Tunnel%20to%20VPS%20%28Ubuntu%20Host%29&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fsetup-free-ipv6-he-tunnel%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fsetup-free-ipv6-he-tunnel%2F&amp;title=How%20to%20Setup%20An%20HE%20Tunnel%20to%20VPS%20%28Ubuntu%20Host%29&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/centos-6-end-of-life-is-coming-upgrade-to-a-new-centos-7-vps-now/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"CentOS 6 End of Life is Coming!
