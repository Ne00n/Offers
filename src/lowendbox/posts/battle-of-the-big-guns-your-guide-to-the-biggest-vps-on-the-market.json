At the time, many users were calling into question the authenticity of the offer. Prior to this offer the highest amount of ram on a vps we had offered was 2GB. Many of the companies providing 2GB plans eventually deadpooled.</p><p>Since that offer, we have featured a handful of other hosts selling high ram (4GB) servers. Selling this much ram at this price requires overselling \u2013 something that these hosts have never hidden. Whilst the term overselling sends a shiver down many peoples spine, it can actually be a good thing. Without overselling these plans would ultimately not be feasible. However, when overselling is not properly managed it can cause many problems.</p><p>A few months on, it is apparent that these plans are in fact not gimmicks. However the perception that these plans are still lingers. Therefore we have spent a bit of time analysing some of these plans, with the intention of showing you what\u2019s currently available for your $7. How do these servers perform?

Interestingly enough, they\u2019re all european based. Despite the cheap hardware and cheap bandwidth of America, there is only one provider offering 4GB+ VPS in America. As this provider consistently receives poor reviews, we took the executive decision not to feature them in the post until they\u2019ve ironed out any problems that they face.</p><p><strong>WaveRide</strong> are a subsidiary of EDIS GmbH, and began providing high ram in <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/9851/waveride-by-edis-4gb-ram-50g-hdd-4-vcpu-2tb-traffic-openvz-solus-5eur-mo/p1\">April 2013</a>. According to website, they decided to launch Waveride so that they could \u201cprovide advanced linux professionals with reliable, extremely low-cost OpenVZ vps containers, on\u2026 enterprise grade hardware\u201d. Whilst EDIS are known for their global network, these plans are currently only available in Vienna, Austria. These plans are entirely unmanaged and unsupported.</p><p>Initially when WaveRide launched, and I obtained a server, there was quite a bit of downtime due to hardware problems. In the end, WaveRide bought a brand new node online and migrated everyone across. This solved the stability issues. After that, downtime was seldom. The VPS performed well, with I/O consistently around 130MB/s and download speeds into the 30MB/s range. I never ran into any issues with bursting the CPU or eating into the ram. See their terms before buying.</p><p><strong>OVerZold</strong> are a subsidiary of Prometeus/IperWeb, who have won our top provider polls on the last three occasions. OVerZold launched on LEB in March 2013, offering 5GB OpenVZ VPS plans in Milan, Italy. With the demand of these plans, and the lack of IPv4 available in europe, they quickly sold out. Unfortunately the 5GB plans may not return at these prices, but some 4GB plans are available on their website.</p><p>My server with OVerZold performed well when I bench marked it. I/O was on average in the 250MB/s range and download/upload speeds averaged 88MB/s. OVerZold are running on the Intel E5-2620, and like WaveRide you also have access to 6 CPU Cores. Reviews on their posts have had nothing but good things to say about them. As with WaveRide, do check their terms before buying.</p><p><strong>OpenVZ.io</strong> are a subsidiary of Iniz, formerly StormVZ. They only began to offer large ram servers last month. Iniz are owned by Web Phase Limited, a UK private limited company. Like OVerZold and WaveRide, they too are using enterprise grade hardware. There website states that they try their best to maintain their nodes at enterprise level to ensure abusers don\u2019t jump aboard.</p><p>When I put my 4GB OpenVZ plan through it\u2019s paces, it performed well. With their network, I could easily get 40~MB/s in both upload and download. I/O was consistently around the 140MB/s mark. Looking at their offer thread, multiple people mention they\u2019ve been suspended for high io/cpu/load. Just how high wasn\u2019t clear.</p><p><strong>DireVPS</strong> are a subsidiary of OpenITC. Whilst we have never featured them on LowEndBox, they were launched by Sean back in <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/7801/4gb-uk-vps-for-4-00-month-6-26-usd\">February on LowEndTalk</a>. Being the first provider to offer so much resources for under $7, there was a lot of disbelief that the offer was actually real. I think the British Sarcasm, most notably in Dire, confused people. Despite offering this amount of ram, they initially <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/7980/what-s-wrong-with-direvps-com/p1\">didn\u2019t sell well</a> due to the scepticism.</p><p>When we tested DireVPS, IO was actually very good at 280MB/s+ consistently. Whilst the network was limited to 100Mbit, it performed decently (although at times did get overloaded). We were able to use pretty much all of our ram allocation for long periods without any problems.</p><p><u>Have your say!</u><br> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=51d40137e4b03d6de547a2a7\"></script><a class=\"OPP-powered-by\" href=\"https://www.murvey.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"></a></p><div style=\"font: 9px arial; color: gray;\"><a class=\"OPP-powered-by\" href=\"https://www.murvey.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">web survey</a></div><p></p><p>I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend hosting anything critical on any of these servers without thoroughly testing. Unfortunately these kind of services can attract abusers and DDoS attacks which would negatively impact anything important that you\u2019re hosting. As I\u2019ve mentioned in a few places, please do read the hosts terms before you sign up as it will save both you and them a headache. All of these providers have their pluses and minuses, do research more to find the provider most suitable for you.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbattle-of-the-big-guns-your-guide-to-the-biggest-vps-on-the-market%2F&amp;t=Battle%20of%20The%20Big%20Guns%20-%20Your%20guide%20to%20the%20Biggest%20VPS%20on%20the%20market\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Battle%20of%20The%20Big%20Guns%20-%20Your%20guide%20to%20the%20Biggest%20VPS%20on%20the%20market&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbattle-of-the-big-guns-your-guide-to-the-biggest-vps-on-the-market%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fbattle-of-the-big-guns-your-guide-to-the-biggest-vps-on-the-market%2F&amp;title=Battle%20of%20The%20Big%20Guns%20-%20Your%20guide%20to%20the%20Biggest%20VPS%20on%20the%20market&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/liam/\" title=\"All posts by Liam\" rel=\"author\">Liam</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a78fb56721359b1d81ed05edb5a734f?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a78fb56721359b1d81ed05edb5a734f?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.lowendbox.com\" class=\"bio-icon bio-icon-website\"></a><p class=\"bio-description\"></p></div></div><div class=\"feedback\"></div></div>"}
