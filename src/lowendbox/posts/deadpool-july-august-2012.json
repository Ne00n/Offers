However the latter was never included in the post due to their controversial 4% \u2018paypal tax\u2019 which made the 512mb plan cost more than the $7 lowendbox monthly limit. After recieving much critism for the paypal tax, basshost later removed it. Their website also featured a <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/media/images/basshost.jpg\">racy image</a> of woman, they later tried to justify it by likening it to GoDaddy\u2019s marketing.</p><p>Their final offer came in February of this year when they offered 256mb vps for $24 per year. In early August 2012 clients began to report that their vps were down and not responding. A month later, one of their co founders, Todd, wrote a long and detailed <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1188474\">thread at webhostingtalk</a> on what had happened.<span id=\"more-2800\"></span></p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/boxvps4.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"/media/images/boxvps4.jpg\" alt=\"Boxvps\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> Boxvps</h3><p><strong>Current Status</strong>: Redirects to <a href=\"http://mabushosting.net/  \">http://mabushosting.net/ </a></p><p>Boxvps were listed <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/tag/boxvps-com/\">7 times</a> throughout 2008 and 2009. Offers ranged from a $6 64mb vps to a $36/Year 512mb openvz vps. In 2010, <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/boxvps-5-512mb-openvz-vps-exclusive-offer/#comment-3088\">LowEndAdmin reported</a> boxvps was being sold. The buyer was reported to be vpsguys.com.</p><p>It is worth noting that BoxVPS were previously known as Mabus Hosting.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/curvehost.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"/media/images/curvehost.jpg\" alt=\"Curvehost\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> CurveHost</h3><p><strong>Current Status</strong>: Domain Expired, GoDaddy renew page.</p><p>Curvehost\u2019s first and <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/curvehost-256mb-openvz-kansas-city/\">only appearance</a> on LowEndBox came in March 2011. Their offer was for a 256mb ram, 50gb hdd and 1000gb of bandwidth located in either Manchester England or Kansas City for $3.99 a month.</p><p>Within days of the order going up people were complaining they could not get in touch with the owner and their services hadn\u2019t been provisioned.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/fastvps.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"/media/images/fastvps.jpg\" alt=\"Fastvps\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> Fastvps</h3><p><strong>Current Status</strong>: IP address not resolvable</p><p>Where do I begin? Fastvps were first and only <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/fastvps-2-50-512mb-openvz-vps-in-scranton/\">listed on lowendbox</a> in December 2011 when \u2018Erik\u2019 sent \u201ctheir \u201cBoxing Week\u201d promotion\u201d into lowendbox. Four plans featured, ranging from a 128MB vps at $12/year to a $6 a month 1GB vps. Servers were in Scranton, presumably with Burstnet or volumedrive.</p><p>Not too long after the post, 4 minutes in fact, Francisco, our in-house early warning host detection radar, speculated the host may in fact be the same cronies who ran UptimeVPS (for those who don\u2019t know who uptimevps were; they were a pump and dump\u2019 scam host). Francisco\u2019s claims were not baseless, Fastvps shared many similarities with Uptimevps \u2013 not least they too were oddly using a .co domain. Other users quickly joined the debate <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/fastvps-2-50-512mb-openvz-vps-in-scranton/#comment-58639\">agreeing</a> that they also thought Fastvps resembled Uptimevps.</p><p>Signs of what was in store for their customers began when, within a few days of their post going live, clients vps\u2019s started being migrated to Miami for no apparent reason. A month later, the servers were migrated again this time to Kansas City. Performance kept going down hill one client summarised his experience by saying <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/fastvps-2-50-512mb-openvz-vps-in-scranton/#comment-65501\">\u201cRidiculous , horrible , scary . Absolutely THE WORST company EVER.\u201d</a>.</p><p>Suspiciously, in July of this year remaining clients were told <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1169247\">Fastvps had been acquired by Stablevps</a> and that their vps would be moved for a 3rd time, this time to OVH. <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=8213686&amp;postcount=4\">Francisco speculated</a> the acquisition was sham, and another excuse to cut costs again. I could not find any information on stablevps.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" class=\"screenshot\" data-src=\"/media/images/flvps.jpg\" alt=\"Flvps\"> Flvps.net</h3><p><strong>Current Status</strong>: Redirects to <a href=\"http://www.kjmanagedsolutions.com\">www.kjmanagedsolutions.com</a></p><p>Flvps were featured in November 2011 after they sent in two packages.
