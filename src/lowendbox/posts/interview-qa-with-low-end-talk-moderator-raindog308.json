Andrew is a long time member of our community and moderator as well. A big thanks to @Raindog308 for taking the time to answer some questions and for his support of the Low End Talk community over the years. So, let\u2019s get started with the questions!</p><p><strong>Tell me about your background? How did you get into IT?</strong></p><p>I actually got my University degree in history. After college, I worked for the university in a marketing research department that was filled with a lot of very nice but also very middle-aged women. Sitting next to us were the Unix guys and they were a lot more my speed. I ended up hanging out with them, then picking up some Unix, and then I became obsessed about everything I could learn about Unix. I ended up working on Sun boxes (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunOS\">SunOS</a> 4.1.x as my first Unix). This was 1994-1995 and Linux was just coming along. Long story short, I geeked out so much on Unix that I eventually got a job doing Unix consulting.</p><p>Sometime later I got into relational databases, and then I went to business school and got into IT management.</p><p><span id=\"more-22546\"></span></p><p><strong>Have you worked in the hosting industry?</strong></p><p>No. I did almost start a hosting company because like a lot of people I was already hosting a bunch of sites for friends/family. But I came to my senses. Reeeaaaalllly old LET readers will remember my StartupSaga site where I documented my hosting company\u2019s startup, but I never went live with it in the end.</p><p><strong>How have you seen LowEndTalk evolve since you joined?</strong></p><p>I first read it in 2010-ish when I wanted to find cheaper VPSes, and then joined in 2011.</p><p>Originally, LowEndBox was kind of the private journal of mad explorer LEAdmin (the original owner). He\u2019d go find some small hoster and try them out and report his findings. He also posted a lot of interesting content on how to do things that were thought impossible in the industry. If you went on WebHostingTalk and said you wanted to host a few low-traffic static sites, the supposedly knowledgeable people there would give you ridiculous specs. <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/yes-you-can-run-18-static-sites-on-a-64mb-link-1-vps/\">LEAadmin would host it on 64MB</a>.</p><p>When Chief bought LET, I\u2019m not sure he really knew what to do with the site. Then CC bought it and LET entered a sad, slow decline, mainly because they never spent any time on the property.</p><p>I\u2019m optimistic now that there\u2019s an independent owner (Jon Biloh) who ponied up to acquire the site and wants to make it better. To be frank, there was a lot of drama and mistrust in the past but I think we\u2019re on a better track now.</p><p><strong>What is life like as a moderator?</strong></p><p>Mostly living a Scrooge McDuck lifestyle, diving into towering heaps of gold coins and pillowing my head on the laps of cooing bikini models.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s life <em>really</em> like as a moderator?</strong></p><p>There\u2019s a ton of spam that we dump. I personally pass out a lot of warnings, but I also clear a lot of old warnings. I rewrote the community rules and did some help desk articles for other mods \u2013 just miscellaneous stuff like that. The other mods do provider tags. I don\u2019t have the expertise to really dig into that.</p><p><strong>What are some of your favorite moments of LET history?</strong></p><p>I\u2019ve loved the black Friday threads with their manic energy, boisterous commentary, and hilarious themes (Emma Watson, Korean pop, etc.) I also remember when BuyVM started and there would be this made dash every month or so when they\u2019d have new stock and people would get up at 2am to get an order in because by 3am everything would be sold out. It was like LowEndAppleStore for a while.</p><p><strong>What are your favorite technologies?</strong></p><p>I love OpenBSD just because the documentation is taken so seriously (compared to Linux where it\u2019s often optional) and there is such a focus on perfection. But I also do a lot with Linux because for web things it\u2019s easier to work with since the ecosystem assumes it. I use Macs for my dekstop/laptop hardware.</p><p>I\u2019m an RDBMS snob so I prefer Oracle, but when I don\u2019t have millions of other people\u2019s money to play with, I use PostGres. I\u2019m also in a long-term relationship with vi. I respect emacs (for one thing, it has vi-mode). I\u2019m a big perl guy, but also speak python, shell, and some of the big-boy languages.</p><p><strong>What do you think of the hosting industry now?</strong></p><p>There was a time when there was a stark cost choice between the lower-priced indy hosts and the big players. But with OVH, Dropbox, Vultr, Linode, etc. there\u2019s more pressure now because for $5 at one of those places, you get a pretty premium product. I think it\u2019s tough to make it as an indy provider these days. The environment has also radically changed. There were very few DDOS attacks when I started reading LET, for example. People didn\u2019t expect to spin up and orchestrate an empire of VMs like they can with the big cloud providers, and most small providers don\u2019t have that kind of API.</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for hosting providers?</strong></p><p>Differentiate yourself. If your plan is to be yet another host selling Linux VMs with Solus with a ThemeForest template based in an OVH datacenter, I think you\u2019ll struggle. People say \u201cI\u2019ll offer better service!\u201d but it needs to be more tangible than that.</p><p>Right now, small indy players lack the cloud features (block storage, hourly billing, resizing on demand, etc.) to compete with big guys and don\u2019t offer an API. A small player who brings those to the table will have a leg up. Also those who can find some niche and really add value \u2013 e.g., if there is a specialized piece of software that you can master and be the go-to host for \u2013 can rise above the herd.</p><p>It\u2019s tough, no doubt.</p><p><strong>What do you do when not reading LET?</strong></p><p>Quite a bit of family stuff. I\u2019m involved with my church. I also have a passion for German Shepherd Dogs. I write fiction, play old-school tabletop roleplaying games, like guns and target shooting, and <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/altorg/dumplog/raindog308/1426553513.nh343.txt\">playing NetHack</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-low-end-talk-moderator-raindog308%2F&amp;t=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Low%20End%20Talk%20Moderator%20Raindog308\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Low%20End%20Talk%20Moderator%20Raindog308&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-low-end-talk-moderator-raindog308%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-low-end-talk-moderator-raindog308%2F&amp;title=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Low%20End%20Talk%20Moderator%20Raindog308&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">4</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
