Multiple blocks assigned to companies in many different countries (US, Canada, South Africa, and China), and many with the same name.&nbsp; Some of these companies don\u2019t even exist any more.&nbsp; \u201cMCI\u201d went defunct in 2006; Arthur Andersen back in 2002.</p><p>So what\u2019s going on here?&nbsp; <strong>Block hijacking.</strong>&nbsp; These blocks are blocks of IP space which the RIR has forgotten or were not properly returned to the RIR.&nbsp; For example, the requester went bankrupt and never relinquished the blocks, or the requester has many blocks and forgot about one assigned to them.&nbsp; Or perhaps the requester has many blocks and has experienced a decreased need but is reluctant to return them (as IPv4 is getting scarce) and so continues to hold on to them without using them.&nbsp; Also, some organizations may request a block and use part or all of it as \u201cprivate\u201d IP space (which should not be done, as there are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">designated IP networks</a> which are not publicly routable).</p><p>A sketchy provider may search IP space to find a block not currently announced and then simply begin announcing it (using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"BGP\">BGP</a>) as their own.&nbsp; This can work for a time, possibly for a long time.&nbsp; But it\u2019s a dangerous game because the actual owner might wake up and start using the block.</p><p>The provider is potentially saving a ton of money by not paying for his IPs.&nbsp; But if you\u2019re a client of that provider, you might suddenly find your network no longer works, usually following swiftly by an email from the provider stating that due to (insert purposefully obtuse technobabble) they\u2019ve had to change some customer IPs.</p><p>How to protect yourself?&nbsp; Find out your provider\u2019s AS number and look it up.&nbsp; You should see all blocks owned in the company\u2019s name (or a related name if the company has changed names or is part of a larger firm).&nbsp; The block may also be in the name of the provider\u2019s upstream provider.</p><p>However, if you see something that seems strange, ask why.&nbsp; If the provider can\u2019t provide a logical explanation, look for a new provider because you may be sitting on squatted space.</p><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8;
