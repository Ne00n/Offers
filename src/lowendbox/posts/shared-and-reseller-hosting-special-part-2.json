This is the final part of the special and we will take a look at three more offers. This two-part special aimed to highlight&nbsp;the fantastic providers in our community both LowEndBox and LowEndTalk. This is mostly focused towards new users wanting to get their first site online or wanting to start their hosting business with a reliable but affordable reseller hosting package.

They run cPanel with CloudLinux and utilize LiteSpeed Web Server for their setup. They state they take&nbsp;daily&nbsp;backups of your data and utilize Softaculous for script selections. They also have free SSL certificates installable at the click of a button within cPanel. They offer full SSD storage for all their shared nodes which are located in Dallas, Texas. <strong>The correct prices will be shown once you enter the checkout page.</strong></p><h2>Shared 5 \u2013 $5 per year.</h2><div class=\"notice\">They have told me that if the plan listed below does not suit you then you may use code <strong>LEBSHARED</strong> to receive 50% off any of the plans on the site&nbsp;.</div><p>This plan offers a respectable 5GB of SSD storage combined with a reasonable 300GB of bandwidth. They impose no restrictions on hosted domains with them and have no restrictions on email accounts, SQL databases or other features. While this is not their cheapest plan it offers a great balance of affordability and specifications. They have other plans on their website which include a larger 10GB storage option and a smaller 1GB storage option and have offered a 50% off any shared package on their site.</p><ul><li>5GB SSD storage</li><li>300GB Bandwidth</li><li>Unlimited hosted domains, email accounts, etc.</li><li>Softaculous and LiteSpeed WebServer are used</li><li>Location:&nbsp;Dallas, TX</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://subnetlabs.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=39&amp;systpl=impactshared&amp;promocode=LEBSHARED\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Order Shared 5</a></p><h2>Reseller 20 \u2013 $30 per year</h2><p>This is their lowest tier reseller plan they offer which is usually $7 per month but they have kindly discounted it to $30 per year.

My main reasoning behind this is that they are a company that has been established for awhile and I don\u2019t see them realisticly closing doors any time soon. These offers are provided out of their Buffalo, New York location. They have stated that they run CloudLinux with cPanel and also have Softaculous for easy deployment of fresh script installations. <strong>The correct prices will be reflected once you hit continue.</strong></p><h2>LEB 35GB Shared \u2013 $14 per year</h2><p>This plan is a mammoth of a plan for a shared site. It has a huge 35GB of RAID10 backed hard&nbsp;disk storage with a a generous 250GB of bandwidth. There are no restrictions to ftp accounts, email accounts or MySQL databases. They do daily backups that are offsite and can be retrieved by simply ticketing in but this doesn\u2019t restrict you from making your own backups manually via cPanel. This a fantastic plan for people starting up their site or possibly wanting to start a forum. With the added bonus of Softaculous you have a lot of choices to what you want to do. They also have RVSiteBuilder and Cloudflare plugins.</p><ul><li>35GB storage</li><li>250GB Bandwidth</li><li>Unlimited email accounts, Subdomains, MySQL etc.</li><li>CloudFare, Softaculous and RVSiteBuilder included</li><li>Location:&nbsp;Buffalo, NY</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://billing.hudsonvalleyhost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=620\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Order LEB 35GB Shared</a></p><h2>50GB Reseller \u2013 $3 per month or $30 per year</h2><div class=\"notice\">They have informed me that if you pay yearly they will <strong>double</strong> your bandwidth for free.

BuyShared is owned by Frantech Solutions who also operate BuyVM. They focus on incredibly affordable but feature packed shared solutions. They utilize CloudLinux and LiteSpeed web server. They have servers in Las Vegas and in Luxembourg. BuyShared is recommended to nearly every user that is looking for reseller or shared hosting over on LowEndTalk not to mention Francisco is also a very active community member over there. They also offer nightly backups of your accounts.</p><h2>Shared 5G \u2013 $10 per year</h2><p>This is not their cheapest plan they offer, that starts at judge $5 per year for&nbsp;1GB SSD storage and 100GB bandwidth but I felt that the Shared 5G plan offered the best balance of resources and price. This plan includes 5GB of SSD storage, 500GB of bandwidth and free SSL certificates from LetsEncrypt. They also have Softaculous for easy script installations and provide every customer with a dedicated IP address. They have no restrictions to the amount of addon domains, databases or email address you can create. This is certainly a great choice for your first site.</p><ul><li>5&nbsp;GB SSD&nbsp;storage</li><li>500&nbsp;GB of bandwidth</li><li>Unlimited&nbsp;addon domains/databases and email addresses</li><li>Free dedicated IP</li><li>Free SSL certificates</li><li>Location: Luxembourg or Las Vegas</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://my.frantech.ca/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1368\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shared 5G Luxembourg</a></p><p><a href=\"https://my.frantech.ca/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shared 5G Las Vegas</a></p><h2>Reseller 20G \u2013 $2 per month</h2><p>This is the cheapest reseller package offered by BuyShared but still retains an excellent balance between resources and price. This plan gets you 20GB of SSD storage and 1TB of bandwidth. You still get all the features included in the shared plan such as LiteSpeed web server, Softaculous and a dedicated IP address for you and your clients to share. They impose no restrictions on accounts you can create and overselling is permitted. This is a fantastic plan for your first hosting venture and with two location to pick from it\u2019s a hard package to beat.</p><ul><li>20&nbsp;GB SSD&nbsp;storage</li><li>1TB of bandwidth</li><li>Unlimited accounts</li><li>Free dedicated IP</li><li>Free SSL certificates</li><li>Location: Luxembourg or Las Vegas</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://my.frantech.ca/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reseller&nbsp;20G Luxembourg</a></p><p><a href=\"https://my.frantech.ca/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1344\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reseller 20G Las Vegas</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I just want to say thank you to all the hosts that were in contact with me and helped make this list. I\u2019m sorry that I was unable to locate any reseller or shared offers not utilizing cPanel but if we get any in I will surely do a list of offers exclusive to providers not using cPanel.
