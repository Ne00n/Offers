Cisneros of </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a seasoned hosting industry veteran who has contributed this article piece for the community.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, growth is inevitable \u2013 and it\u2019s important to be planned and ready for it. Are you currently hosting your website on Shared Hosting? In this article, we\u2019ll go over some signs to watch out for throughout your growth journey \u2013 we will be pointing out some signs that you\u2019ve outgrown your current shared hosting environment and should consider upgrading to a VPS (</span><b>V</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">irtual </span><b>P</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rivate </span><b>S</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">erver).</span></p><p>Read more to continue\u2026</p><p><span id=\"more-22373\"></span></p><ul><li><b>Degrading/Diminishing Website Performance</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you noticed your website is performing slower than usual, it could mean that your website is increasing in traffic and that you are now exceeding the resource limit that shared hosting providers typically impose per account to ensure stability for everyone hosted on the server. More often than not, these limits are implemented by software the hosting provider implements called CloudLinux \u2013 which limits certain resources your account can use, such as IOPS, I/O, RAM, NPROC, CPU. It\u2019s no secret that shared hosting is perfectly capable to meet the needs of basic and intermediate websites, but as you start to grow in traffic and visitors, diminishing performance can be a sign that you should consider upgrading to a VPS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Out of Storage Space</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are running out of storage space on your shared hosting account, it can be a sign that you need to either upgrade your storage allocation of your account, or use this as an opportunity to upgrade to a VPS. As this is an obvious sign you\u2019ll need a bigger package, it can in some cases be more cost effective to actually upgrade to a VPS, depending on the storage you need.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>When Shared Hosting is No Longer Cost Effective</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Touching a bit more on the above point, if you notice that you are not receiving an appropriate value for the resources you\u2019re receiving, it may be time to upgrade to a VPS. For example, in some cases, it can actually be more expensive to upgrade to, say, a 300 GB shared hosting plan, compared to purchasing a VPS with 300 GB of storage. This is because you receive a better value (generally speaking) when you buy a bigger package that already includes the additional resources you\u2019re in need of, instead of paying the additional resource rate. This, of course, varies from hosting provider to hosting provider, but </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LowEndBox</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a resource website that features a wide variety of deals from various different hosting providers to browse from! Be sure to factor in any additional costs that your business/website demands, this can include but not limited to: control panel, software licenses, web server licenses. At the same time, with the growth you\u2019ve experienced, it may be safe to say that your budget would allow for additional resources, full root access, and peace of mind. If while you\u2019re at it, looking for a free control panel to save some more costs, check out this article which covers </span><a href=\"https://blog.racknerd.com/free-control-panels-for-linux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free control panels for Linux</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Closing Thoughts</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you resonated with one or more of the above points, it can be a sign that you need to invest a few extra dollars (or potentially save some money) by migrating over to a VPS solution. Low End Box is dedicated to helping people run websites and services based upon cost effective VPS\u2019s, and the best part is, all VPS\u2019s featured on this website include full root access, which means you\u2019re in total control and are able to set up your own environment as you require, and even choose your server\u2019s operating system.
