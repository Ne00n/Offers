In this posts, which we will try to do monthly from now on, we\u2019ll give you some highlights of what happened the previous month(s).</p><p>If you have any news or items you would like to have considered for this roundup, please PM them to @CommunityRoundup on LowEndTalk.com!</p><hr><h2>LowEndTalk helps XFuse_Duke</h2><p>XFuse_Duke, a long-time member of LowEndTalk and a VPS hosting provider, has had a very unfortunate accident on his motorcycle resulting in a badly injured leg. As a result of that he was not only out of a job, but he also had hospital bills piling up. In his initial report he already had over $85,000 worth of bills with more to come. Community member @jvnadr was kind enough to make this known to the LowEndTalk community. As a result of that thread, Duke got quite some donations thanks to the generosity of both providers and other members. He\u2019s doing a lot better now and both him and his wife would like to thank the LowEndTalk community for all their help!</p><p><span id=\"more-6053\"></span></p><hr><h2></h2><h2>INIZ ownership change</h2><p>Patrick Hayward sold INIZ recently.&nbsp; It is now owned by \u2018Zeniva Limited\u2019. According to the official e-mail that was sent out the plans and pricing are to remain the same, as are the number of brands they own and operate. Patrick will stay aboard for a while to ensure a smooth transition. Support is going to be a focus point for the new owner; according to some it has not been up to par, so hopefully the new owners will be able to change that!</p><hr><h2></h2><h2>123Systems ownership change</h2><p>Only months ago, ChicagoVPS acquired 123Sytems from former owner Andrew. Unfortunately, they were not able to turn the company into something a lot better. A couple of weeks ago, Velocity Servers Network Exchange (VSNX), the owner of LowEndBox, LowEndTalk, and ColoCrossing, purchased 123Systems from ChicagoVPS\u2019 parent. Hopefully they will be able to turn things around at 123Systems and improve the quality of the servers and service!</p><hr><h2></h2><h2>New hosts on LowEndBox</h2><p>Over the past two months, three hosts were featured for the first time:</p><ul><li><a title=\"Frixel Solutions \u2013 Dedicated servers in California, USA starting at $15/month\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/frixel-solutions-dedicated-servers-in-california-usa-starting-at-15month/\">Frixel Solutions</a>: @shovenose\u2019s new adventure; after shovehost stopped trading, Michael took some time to start up a new business and do it right.</li><li><a title=\"VirtNetwork \u2013 $7/month 2GB and $3.95/month 1GB KVM in Buffalo\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/virtnetwork-7month-2gb-and-3-95month-1gb-kvm-in-buffalo/\">VirtNetwork</a>: @GVH_Alex\u2019s new adventure: after having spent time as a GreenValueHost employee, Alex started his own business.</li><li><a title=\"SSDHosting.io \u2013 $4.85/month 1GB Xen VPS with SSD in Hemel Heampstead\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/ssdhosting-io-4-85month-1gb-xen-vps-with-ssd-in-hemel-heampstead/\">SSDHosting.io</a>: a UK-based entity with servers in Hemel Heampstead, UK; a location that\u2019s quite rare around the LowEnd scene</li></ul><p>Out of these three, SSDHosting.io seems to have gotten the best reviews thus far. Hopefully we\u2019ll keep seeing all of them back in the future, so good luck to you guys and welcome to LowEnd!</p><hr><h2></h2><h2>Final notes</h2><p>That\u2019s it for this update!
