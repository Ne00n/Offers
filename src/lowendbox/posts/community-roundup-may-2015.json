We\u2019re almost halfway through this year and it\u2019s becoming an interesting year at that.</p><p>As always, if you have something interesting to share for the Community Roundup, please send a PM to @CommunityRoundup at <a href=\"http://lowendtalk.com\">LowEndTalk</a>!</p><h2>LowEndBox offer pipeline</h2><p>For a long, long time now (as long as I can remember) our helpdesk has been my sole source of input for offers on LowEndBox. While it\u2019s a very valuable asset, it has brought us to the situation where both we (LEB) and providers had gotten to a situation where there were certain expectations. Providers were demanding their offer be posted after they submitted it, we got in the situation where we considered that our sole offer input. On top of that, we stopped listing providers because they got DDoS-ed after having an offer featured. Ultimately, this has brought us to the situation where it seemed like we are here for just the providers and not the consumers/visitors.</p><p>I felt that this situation is undesirable and it not what LEB should be like. So, I\u2019d like to clarify two things: 1) from this moment on we will no longer be \u201cshielding\u201d providers by removing or not listing valuable content on either LET or LEB, content valuable to our visitors, because of the <em>possibility</em> of them getting attacked; 2) the helpdesk is nothing more and nothing less than a <strong>suggestion box</strong> where <em>people</em> (not just providers) can share interesting offers (which they may have found) for consideration for listing. Since two weeks now, the input for my planning has been offers I find/providers I know combined with offers from the helpdesk. I\u2019m going to continue down that road in order to make LEB more interesting for our visitors.</p><p><span id=\"more-7056\"></span></p><h2>We need your feedback!</h2><p><em>Copied straight from the last post, here\u2019s the request again. I\u2019d love to get some more valuable input in order to improve LEB!</em></p><p>As part of our ongoing effort to improve both LowEndBox and LowEndTalk I\u2019ve launched to threads on LowEndTalk to gather feedback for either site. You can find those threads <a href=\"http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/49962/how-can-we-improve-lowendbox#latest\">here for LowEndBox</a> and <a href=\"http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/49968/how-can-we-improve-lowendtalk#latest\">here for LowEndTalk</a>. Our goal is to gather genuine and useful feedback and do something with it, all taking into account sustainable pace while doing so. The first few good suggestions have been made, of which one I will immediately start executing: tagging hosts with IPv6. I realize this is a small one, but we have to start somewhere.</p><p>We appreciate everybody taking the time to give us some feedback, so thank you for that! We do ask that you keep it constructive and realistic (banning all online.net offers, for example, is neither constructive nor realistic).</p><h2>New providers</h2><p>In May 2015, the following providers were listed for the first time:</p><ul><li><a title=\"AbeloHost \u2013 \u20ac43.75/month 4GB Intel Xeon E3-1220v3 dedicated server in Dronten, Netherlands\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/abelohost-e43-75month-4gb-intel-xeon-e3-1220v3-dedicated-server-in-dronten-netherlands/\">AbeloHost</a></li><li><a title=\"WebSound \u2013 \u00a39/year 256MB KVM and more in Las Vegas, USA\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/websound-9year-256mb-kvm-and-more-in-las-vegas-usa/\">WebSound</a></li><li><a title=\"LinuxServers.host \u2013 OpenVZ VPS in West Palm Beach starting at $3/month for 512MB\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/linuxservers-host-openvz-vps-in-west-palm-beach-starting-at-3month-for-512mb/\">LinuxServers.host</a></li><li><a title=\"Incloudibly/CoinsHost \u2013 Switzerland Xen VPS starting at $9.24USD/quarter for 512MB\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/incloudiblycoinshost-switzerland-xen-vps-starting-at-9-24usdquarter-for-512mb/\">Incloudibly/Coinshost</a></li></ul><p>Not as many as the previous months, I\u2019m afraid, but I personally don\u2019t consider that an issue as long as we keep focusing on sharing new hosts combined with interesting offers from existing hosts!</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fcommunity-roundup-may-2015%2F&amp;t=Community%20Roundup%20-%20May%202015\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Community%20Roundup%20-%20May%202015&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fcommunity-roundup-may-2015%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fcommunity-roundup-may-2015%2F&amp;title=Community%20Roundup%20-%20May%202015&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/community-news-new-ddos-protected-vps-service-by-racknerd/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
