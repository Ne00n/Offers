The first one is the difference of vision between me and ColoCrossing on where to go with these sites. The second one is the amount of time I have available, which no longer matches the amount of time the sites require.</p><p><span id=\"more-8063\"></span></p><p>I\u2019ve had a great time running the websites for the past two years and I couldn\u2019t have had that without the amazing community we have here. There are a number people in particular who have helped out a lot; Spirit, vedran, Lee, AnthonySmith, Nekki, jcaleb, mikho and jarland have all done an amazing job in helping me out and I\u2019m extremely greatful for that. I\u2019d also like to thank Alex and Jon from ColoCrossing, who have trusted me to run their sites and have supported me where appropriate.</p><p>It is with pleasure that I can announce my successor: jarland! Truth be told that two years ago I never thought this would ever be possible ;-) I can\u2019t think of anyone else to better succeed me than him though, and I wish him all the best.</p><p>I will still be around in my current capacity as I transition everything to him/ColoCrossing and will remain a normal member after that. I absolutely look forward to enjoying these sites as a normal member once again!</p><p>Maarten</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fits-been-a-great-ride%2F&amp;t=It%27s%20been%20a%20great%20ride\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=It%27s%20been%20a%20great%20ride&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fits-been-a-great-ride%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fits-been-a-great-ride%2F&amp;title=It%27s%20been%20a%20great%20ride&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/mpkossen/\" title=\"All posts by Maarten Kossen\" rel=\"author\">Maarten Kossen</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67eeccea1ee5a1ce2f93adc061f69a5f?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">Maarten Kossen was the administrator of LowEndBox from 2013 to 2015, and brought many ideas and improvements to the website during his leadership.
