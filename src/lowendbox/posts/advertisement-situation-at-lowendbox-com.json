This is a \u201chouse-keeping\u201d post so please ignore if you are only interested in cheap virtual private server offers :) I am posting here because \u201cadvertising\u201d has been a frequently asked question by the hosting providers.</p><p>LowEndBox.com was started back in early 2008 as I was hunting for cheap VPS boxes for my processing nodes for one of the projects I had at that time. Basically the rule was simple \u2014 I only wanted to pay up to $7/month for VPS in multiple locations, and I did not really care about memory, disk space and bandwidth. The nodes just need to connect to my DB and MQ (hosted at Linode), download requests, process them and send it back. Done! Any VPS with 64MB memory can do it.</p><p><span id=\"more-1227\"></span></p><p>However it turns out \u201cmy cheap VPS hosting notepad\u201d has grown in popularity over time. According to Google Analytics it has received 130,000+ page views over the last 30 days from visitors all around the globe (top 3 being US, UK and China). So for the last year or so I have been selling banner ads on this blog via <a href=\"http://buysellads.com/buy/detail/12523\">BuySellAds</a>. Due to popularity I have to increase the price of the ads twice (and maybe 3rd time soon). However there is still a <b>long</b> queue of advertisers. When <a href=\"http://www.pingvps.com/\">PingVPS</a> gave up their spot 2 days ago, BuySellAds was swarmed by the requests from advertisers (31 waiting on the spot when I last checked). <a href=\"http://www.hostvillage.com/\">HostVillage</a> got in first, and sorry for others who are still waiting.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/pix/buysellads-lowendbox.png\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"/media/pix/buysellads-lowendbox.png\" alt=\"BuySellAds - LowEndBox\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> <em>(By the way it was a mistake by myself at the beginning to grant Yomura Holdings 4 of the 8 125\u00d7125 spots. All ads now need to be approved and I won\u2019t let the same provider take more than 1 ad space.)</em></p><p>BuySellAds has suggested to make dramatic increase on the price \u2014 which I think would not suit this niche where I actually promote \u201ccheap\u201d hosting. So what\u2019s from this point onwards?</p><ul><li>I am still taking the <b>\u201cno affiliation sales\u201d</b> stance. I know you guys fought for the advertising spot and sent me heaps of emails each day because it actually converts for you. But I much prefer to keep this blog independent from hosting providers. The only one I am sort-of affiliated to is <a href=\"http://www.quickweb.co.nz/\">QuickWeb</a> as they provide this 80MB Xen VPS to me for <em>free</em>. No kickbacks from any sale made here.</li><li>I have suggested to BuySellAds on whether I can increase the number of available slots instead of increasing price (for example, show random 8 out of 12 available spots). So more can have chance. I\u2019ll see what BSA says.</li><li>There is a possibility to move to another platform (Google AdSense?) that supports more dynamic bidding. One potential problem with AdSense is that whoever has the biggest pocket (usually) wins, regardless whether it is in context or not. LowEndBox is about cheap VPS providers, and I don\u2019t want to see Rackspace or LiquidWeb taking over all spots.</li></ul><p>Anyway. So here is the message to all potential advertisers \u2014 <em>I am working on it!</em> Yet I don\u2019t have enough time in my day so please be patient.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fadvertisement-situation-at-lowendbox-com%2F&amp;t=Advertisement%20Situation%20at%20LowEndBox.com\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Advertisement%20Situation%20at%20LowEndBox.com&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fadvertisement-situation-at-lowendbox-com%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fadvertisement-situation-at-lowendbox-com%2F&amp;title=Advertisement%20Situation%20at%20LowEndBox.com&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
