I hope all is well! I\u2019ve been working on some ways to increase the quality of offers we\u2019re posting and while I\u2019ve been picky when selecting offers, I still want to&nbsp;post&nbsp;frequently enough so we get something for everyone. This can be difficult.</p><p>Let\u2019s face it: you all want something just a little bit different. Specs that one person might want might be totally overkill for another. For the next person they might not be good enough. Everyone has a different need.</p><p>I made an attempt to get some suggestions when I first came to LowEndBox \u2013 and I\u2019m afraid I went about it the wrong way. I asked what you wanted and got a lot of great feedback. I took that information and tried to manually find the right offers. This proved to be time consuming and difficult to manage. Above all else, I think it was largely ineffective.</p><p>But I live and I learn. And I want to try something just a little bit different.</p><p>This time around, I\u2019d like to get some feedback from you guys, and then make sure that every single provider that decides to submit an offer takes a look at what\u2019s important to you prior to submitting an offer.</p><p>We have some pretty obvious Official Rules <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/submit-an-offer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">for submitting an offer</a> to LowEndBox. I want us to create the \u201cunofficial rules\u201d of LowEndBox which will serve as a list of \u201cdo\u2019s and dont\u2019s\u201d for providers to consider when they submit an offer. Hopefully, this will assist them in submitting offers that will garner a good amount of interest when posted.</p><p>What do you think would be some good \u201cunofficial rules\u201d for LowEndBox?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flets-help-these-providers-out%2F&amp;t=Let%27s%20help%20these%20providers%20out...\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Let%27s%20help%20these%20providers%20out...&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flets-help-these-providers-out%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flets-help-these-providers-out%2F&amp;title=Let%27s%20help%20these%20providers%20out...&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">3</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/mzelasko/\" title=\"All posts by Matt Zelasko\" rel=\"author\">Matt Zelasko</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\"></p></div></div><div class=\"feedback\"></div></div>"}
