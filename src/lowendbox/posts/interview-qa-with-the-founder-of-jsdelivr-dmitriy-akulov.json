Originally I am from Ukraine but I grew up and went to school in Greece.</span></p><p><b><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyMjUiIGhlaWdodD0iMzAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjI1IDMwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-24842 alignleft\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmitriy-akulov-dmytro-225x300.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"20\" data-srcset=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmitriy-akulov-dmytro-225x300.jpg.webp 225w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmitriy-akulov-dmytro-768x1024.jpg.webp 768w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmitriy-akulov-dmytro-1152x1536.jpg.webp 1152w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmitriy-akulov-dmytro.jpg.webp 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\">Tell us what jsdelivr is all about and what the project\u2019s goals are.</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jsDelivr</a> is a free multi-CDN for open source projects, developers and webmasters.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently we proxy all of Github, npm registry and WordPress addons registry. This means we can load any file located on those services.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developers get an easy to use method to distribute their code without having to pay for commercial CDN services or think about infrastructure management and devops.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website owners use <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jsDelivr</a> as a quick method to grab and load the libraries and files they need while at the same time optimizing the performance of their websites.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently we utilize Cloudflare, Fastly and Stackpath to provide the best possible performance and uptime to our users. In mainland China we have an ICP license and use Quantil to serve our content.</span></p><p><b>What inspired you to begin this project?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was always a challenge to find the libraries you need, download them, upload them, add the correct paths\u2026 And later you would have to keep them updated by repeating the same process.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I had the idea to build a better Google Hosted Libraries with community contributed libraries, an easy to use interface and a big focus on performance and availability.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing servers was always something I enjoyed, and so building the infrastructure for this was a really exciting project for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id=\"more-24840\"></span></p><p><b>You\u2019ve been around for more than 10 years and are serving 62 billion requests a month with 1.7 Petabytes of traffic. That\u2019s equivalent to every human being on the planet making almost 8 requests per month. Is it just me or is that amazing?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I agree, it\u2019s really amazing. And most interestingly we keep growing fast without any active marketing or promotion. These numbers really inspire me to continue working on it and build more and more new features and improvements.</span></p><p><b>Looking at your infographic, I count almost 800 POPs. Is that number growing? Where would you like to see future POPs?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That number slowly grows as our partners add more POPs themselves. I think Latin America is somewhat underserved at the moment, as well as many parts of Asia. But slowly more and more providers are starting to invest in those locations and improving our total performance.</span></p><p><b>Your web site says you\u2019re \u201cfaster than any other CDN\u201d. Bold claim! How is that possible?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is based on data from CDNPerf </span><a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1s89aef57k0w2q5/chrome_2020-09-01_20-07-32.png\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1s89aef57k0w2q5/chrome_2020-09-01_20-07-32.png</span></a></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we combine multiple CDN providers we are able to use the best performing provider in every region separately. That really improves our performance and at the same time improves our uptime. As you might see in the news some CDN providers have outages from time to time that take down a big part of the internet. Those outages don\u2019t have any effect on <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jsDelivr</a> because we simply remove that provider from our logic and continue serving our users normally.</span></p><p><b>You must have an interesting viewpoint on Internet usage. Do you see any global-scale trends in terms of Internet usage? Is one region growing faster than another, etc.?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsdelivr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because we plan to release some public stats on this exact topic and allow everyone to use <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jsDelivr</a> as a data source of internet trends as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>How much of the code that runs jsdelivr custom-written? What languages, tools, etc. do you use for your infrastructure?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything is custom written from scratch. We are using node.js to serve all of our origin traffic and support all of our features like on-the-fly minimization and file combinations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We run the code on multiple servers in multiple regions to ensure high availability even on the origin level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out our infographic for more details: </span><a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/network/infographic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.jsdelivr.com/network/infographic</span></a></p><p><b>You are only public CDN with a valid ICP license issued by the Chinese government. What does that mean and how did that come about?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really wanted to offer the best CDN for everyone. That meant developers and websites in China as well. Especially them since many services are not available there or are way too slow.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started doing some research on the topic until I found an excited <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jsDelivr</a> user from China who decided to help us out. With his help we were able to set everything up and at the same time get sponsored by Quantil who offered us their huge network of POPs in mainland China.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that we truly became a global CDN. Our users can be sure that when they use <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jsDelivr</a> their files will load instantly everywhere, including China,</span></p><p><b>I just have to ask\u2026I was playing with your network map and toggled \u201cOther\u201d on and off and it looks like the \u201cOther\u201d provider only covers Madagascar. Do you deploy a custom setup there (or elsewhere)?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We did, but not anymore unfortunately. Many years ago we had our own custom POPs complementing the sponsoring CDNs. Madagascar was one of those locations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But over time it became redundant as the performance difference wasn\u2019t meaningful anymore and so the resources and time we had to spend to maintain the custom POPs wasn\u2019t worth it anymore.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Got to update the map :)</span></p><p><b>What are the biggest headaches to running a CDN \u2013 DDOS, security, or\u2026?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now after 10 years we have solved most of our problems. Now the only headache is lack of resources to do everything we want.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we are sponsored by DigitalOcean for example it\u2019s not nearly enough to run all of our infrastructure. So I pay by myself for most of our servers running our backend and many supporting services.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means instead of just scaling our servers we have to be clever about it and fix any high load issues using code. We have built a complex system with multi-layered caching on many different levels to lower the load on our origin servers while maintaining the best possible uptime and performance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many new ideas we have for cool features also require lots of CPU and RAM to work, so instead of just coding them in a week and going live we have to spend months finding ways to make them work on a 100billion requests scale while not having me go bankrupt :)</span></p><p><b>The top of your site says you\u2019re looking for contributors. What kind of contributors are you looking for?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are looking for all kinds of developers to help us out. From super senior node.js dev to help on the origin to students and junior devs to help us with stuff like fixing our website, building plugins and addons for CMS, integrations with IDEs and so on\u2026</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We appreciate all help!</span></p><p><b>Anything else you\u2019d like to tell us about this awesome project?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We plan to release new and exciting features soon that will make it easier for our users to use <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jsDelivr</a> for their javascript dependencies and allow them to utilize packages authored in ESM and CJS formats.</span></p><p><strong>On another note,&nbsp;</strong><strong>you\u2019re launching another new project call appfleet. It looks like it\u2019s pay-by-the-hour Docker hosting. What can you tell us about it?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://appfleet.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appfleet</a> aims to become 2 things. A simple to use docker hosting platform, and a flexible edge hosting provider. It will allow users to deploy containers globally to multiple regions at the same time. On top of that it will provide lots of unique features like the use of any TCP or UDP port. Making this a much more flexible alternative to current serverless solutions that focus mostly on HTTP.</p><p>Besides regular HTTP services like APIs and websites, you can also deploy DNS, distributed databases, video streaming services, and more!</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MjgiIGhlaWdodD0iOTAiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3MjggOTAiPjxyZWN0IHdpZHRoPSIxMDAlIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiIGZpbGw9IiNjZmQ0ZGIiLz48L3N2Zz4=\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24843\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/728x90.gif.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\"></p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-the-founder-of-jsdelivr-dmitriy-akulov%2F&amp;t=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20the%20Founder%20of%20jsdelivr%2C%20Dmitriy%20Akulov\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20the%20Founder%20of%20jsdelivr%2C%20Dmitriy%20Akulov&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-the-founder-of-jsdelivr-dmitriy-akulov%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-the-founder-of-jsdelivr-dmitriy-akulov%2F&amp;title=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20the%20Founder%20of%20jsdelivr%2C%20Dmitriy%20Akulov&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">1</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
