For those who might not know, Jarland actually ran Low End Box and Low End Talk for a period of time a few years ago before becoming too busy on rapidly expanding MXroute. So let\u2019s get started with the interview!</span></p><p><strong>What can you tell us about yourself, how you got to where you are today, and your role at your company?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started in this industry as just another clueless newbie. I was blessed to have been given a chance by a lot of people. Most of those people were from LowEndTalk.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started a VPS provider, Catalyst Host, with Ryan Arp many years back. This experience led me to a job at HostGator as a system administrator, an incredible expansion of responsibility and learning. That experience led me to a career as a Platform Support Specialist, and ultimately to a Team Lead on the support team at DigitalOcean. In my last year at DigitalOcean, I worked as Social Engagement Manager, overseeing support via social media and public forums.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late 2013, while still working at HostGator, I started MXroute because I saw how much trouble people were having just getting an email from point A to point B, and I thought I could solve that problem. Here we are in 2020, and I still own and operate MXroute, and I\u2019m also the Support Manager for QuickPacket.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My career has been and remains to be the most fulfilling one that I could have imagined. I wake up every day, excited to sit at my desk and get to work.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-22286\"></span></p><p><strong>What advice would you give to business owners today or those aspiring to become one?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re kind, generous, and honest, most people will reward you for it. You have to work hard on top of it, but that hard work won\u2019t get you very far if no one enjoys doing business with you.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the most significant characteristic that makes your company unique in today\u2019s evolving market landscape?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most unique is how we deliver email and take IP reputation off the table. We try again and again, from different IP ranges, until we\u2019re confident a recipient just isn\u2019t going to accept an email. We have a cool outline of it here: </span><a href=\"https://mxroute.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Email-Server.png\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://mxroute.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Email-Server.png</span></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you enjoy most about your role? What do you find most difficult?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most enjoyable part of my role is server administration. I love parsing logs to find the weak points of the infrastructure and then crafting solutions to solve those problems. It sounds boring, but someone has to love it. The most challenging part is when I don\u2019t have an answer. We\u2019re still a small business, and we don\u2019t employ a development team. There are sometimes hurdles that we\u2019re just not ready to get over, and that can be frustrating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Both personally and professionally, what guiding principles ground you?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be fair, generous, and honest. Most people don\u2019t mind if you mess up. Mistakes are not limited to companies of a specific size. What people want to know is that when you do make a mistake, you\u2019ll be fair and generous in making up for it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell me about some of the new and exciting things you are working on at your company?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of it isn\u2019t too exciting for end-users, but it\u2019s the foundation. We\u2019re working on better internal documentation and consistency for rolling out servers, and continually reviewing the reasons that emails fail to be received to find out how the entire stack can be better tomorrow than it was today. It doesn\u2019t make for great conversation, but it\u2019s the work people expect when they give you money to take care of the problem.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why should customers trust you and your business?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re hiring someone to do a job, you want someone passionate and motivated to do the best job that they can do. That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking people to do, hire me to handle your email. I genuinely don\u2019t think you can find anyone as passionate about it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the past you were the one running Low End Talk and Low End Box. What do you think of the recent changes to the community and do you have any advice?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think my opinions on the subject are unpopular with some of the older members, and while I respect it, my views remain the same. You, Jon, are in a new position to dedicate more human resources (mainly yourself) to the community than you have been able to in the past. It hasn\u2019t had that kind of dedication in a long time, not even remotely excluding my time on it as I worked at DigitalOcean, MXroute, and LEB/T at the time. With your work ethic and time to give toward it, LEB/T will grow exponentially.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice is to work hard to make it accommodating to new users. The biggest threat to LEB/T has always been that we old-timers slowly get bored and disappear, and we\u2019re not very trusting of newcomers. That creates an environment with an expiration date.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final thoughts and anything you would like to add?</strong></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my eyes, the community at LEB/T directly propped up my success in my career by giving me the chance to learn how to serve them well. I\u2019ll always be incredibly thankful for that, and do my best to give back to the community in any way that I can, whether that means a quality service provided or a hot meal if you\u2019re ever in East Texas.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like to learn more about MXroute, click the banner below to be sent to their website or review <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/?s=mxroute&amp;searchsubmit=Find\">their past Low End Box offers</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://mxroute.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMjAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzIwIDEwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22288 size-full\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Small-Banner.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"100\" data-srcset=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Small-Banner.png.webp 320w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Small-Banner-300x94.png.webp 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\"></a></p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-mxroute-owner-jarland-donnell-on-email-delivery-the-hosting-industry-and-a-look-back%2F&amp;t=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20MXroute%20Owner%20Jarland%20Donnell%20on%20Email%20Delivery%2C%20the%20Hosting%20Industry%20and%20a%20look%20back\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20MXroute%20Owner%20Jarland%20Donnell%20on%20Email%20Delivery%2C%20the%20Hosting%20Industry%20and%20a%20look%20back&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-mxroute-owner-jarland-donnell-on-email-delivery-the-hosting-industry-and-a-look-back%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-mxroute-owner-jarland-donnell-on-email-delivery-the-hosting-industry-and-a-look-back%2F&amp;title=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20MXroute%20Owner%20Jarland%20Donnell%20on%20Email%20Delivery%2C%20the%20Hosting%20Industry%20and%20a%20look%20back&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">58</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
