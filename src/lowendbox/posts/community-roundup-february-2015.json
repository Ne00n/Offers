We\u2019ve got some interesting bits and pieces that happened this month, among which a follow-up of the EU VAT Rules mentioned in the last update.</p><p>As always, if you have any news to report for this update, please PM @CommunityRoundup at LowEndTalk.com to share it.</p><h2>EU VAT Rules update</h2><p>Several more US-based providers have announced they will start to charge VAT soon to EU-based customers without at VAT number. This is a result of a new law introduced last year and activated on January 1st that requires every business trading in digital goods and services in the EU should charge VAT in the country of the customer. While this law is a burden to many and I\u2019ve personally haven\u2019t seen any benefits of it for us, the consumers, it\u2019s alive and kicking and companies are following up on it.</p><p>Vultr is one of the most recent to announce they will start to charge VAT (effective March 1, 2015) and I\u2019m sure others will have to follow suit soon if the EU doesn\u2019t decide to abandon this new law (or modify it). So, if you do have a valid VAT ID, be sure to put it down where possible to prevent nasty surprises on your invoices.</p><p><span id=\"more-6519\"></span></p><h2>GVH Customers going to XFuse; GVH DB being used for SPAM</h2><p>An interesting development followed by a \u201cshocking\u201d development last months. At first it was announced that GVH\u2019s VPS customers would be transferred to XFuse Solutions in a deal with undisclosed conditions. There\u2019s been no details on when anything is going to take place and GVH has seemingly not sent out an e-mail to all of their customers, but if you currently have a VPS with GVH it will soon be moved to XFuse Solutions. Most of the original pricing is going to be honored for now, with some exceptions here and there. Let\u2019s hope (and I have a lot of faith this will happen) that XFuse Solutions will take better care of all those clients.</p><p>As a nasty twist to this whole story it seems a former GVH employee had a copy of the GVH client database on his PC. While this may not be a surprise for some, it\u2019s a nasty surprise for others. Especially now that database was supposedly \u201caccidentally\u201d included in the compilation of an e-mail marketing list for said former GVH employee\u2019s new business. So, a word of warning here: if you were a GVH customer last year there\u2019s a big chance that address could be included in future e-mail marketing campaigns, so be on the lookout for e-mails you didn\u2019t sign up for.</p><h2>Upcoming helpdesk changes</h2><p>Ever since I\u2019ve taken over the leadership of LEB and LET from Liam, we\u2019ve been struggling with the amount of tickets in the helpdesk and responding to them. As part of my effort to improve things, I will soon add a new and updated template for offers submissions that hosts may (<strong>must</strong>) use to submit offers for LowEndBox. This new template will save us a lot of work checking tickets to see if all required data is there and it will give you the assurance that your ticket can be processed quickly, and hopefully, without any follow-ups.</p><p>Other minor changes that have taken place are the removal of the \u2018Critical\u2019 status (as it was just abused) and the removed of several pre-submission checkboxes that were only put in place because of a \u201cbad few\u201d.</p><h2>New providers</h2><p>February saw some new providers being listed:</p><ul><li><a title=\"FastVPS Eesti \u2013 \u20ac2.90/month 1GB OpenVZ SSD in Estonia\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/fastvps-eesti/\">FastVPS Eesti</a></li><li><a title=\"RackMine \u2013 OpenVZ and KVM in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia starting at $3.99/month\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/rackmine-openvz-and-kvm-in-kuala-lumpur-malaysia-starting-at-3-99month/\">RackMine</a></li><li><a title=\"VENETX \u2013 $3.99/month 3GB OpenVZ in Roubaix, France\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/venetx-3-99month-3gb-openvz-in-roubaix-france/\">VENETX</a></li><li><a title=\"LowLatencyServers \u2013 $5/month 512MB Xen VPS in Chicago\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/lowlatencyservers-5month-512mb-xen-vps-in-chicago/\">LowLatencyServers</a></li><li><a title=\"CityWideHost \u2013 49$/month Quad Core 16GB dedicated server in Phoenix, AZ, USA\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/citywidehost-49month-quad-core-16gb-dedicated-server-in-phoenix-az-usa/\">CityWideHost</a></li><li><a title=\"OpticServers \u2013 Unmetered transfer OpenVZ VPS in Surrey, UK starting at \u00a32/month\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/opticservers-unmetered-transfer-openvz-vps-in-surrey-uk-starting-at-2month/\">OpticServers</a></li><li><a title=\"AheadCloud \u2013 USA-based OpenVZ: 1GB for $3/month and 2GB for $6/month\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/aheadcloud-usa-based-openvz-1gb-for-3month-and-2gb-for-6month/\">AheadCloud</a></li></ul><p>I\u2019m proud to be featuring more new providers and to have heavily brought down the number of \u201crepeat offers\u201d.
