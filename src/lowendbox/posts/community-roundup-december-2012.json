I\u2019m so so so sorry for the delay with the Roundup, however with the limited time that I have had thus far, and with running the Q4 Poll, I was unable to post it until now. Here is a roundup of December\u2019s news.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/neonpanel.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/neonpanel.jpg.webp\" alt=\"neon\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> Neon Panel</h3><p><strong>An open source multilevel and multiuser website control panel which is based on nginx, mysql and php.</strong></p><p>A few community members have launched Neon \u2013 a primarily PHP based control panel for website and server management. According to the project, once Neon has been installed on a server \u201cit will allow an administrator to create and manage user accounts. Those user accounts will each be assigned a private file structure and will be able to manage their own domains, DNS, email, MySQL databases and backups\u201d.</p><p>Unlike other panels on the market, such as cPanel, Neon will be \u201can open source control panel that is designed to make a profit and support Nginx by default\u201d. The Neon team say that while there are other panels on the market, the problem with them are that they don\u2019t support Nginx by default or are not maintained.</p><p>Neon aims to fix this. They\u2019re building it for Debian (Linux) and are designing it \u201cfrom the ground up to be fast and easy to use\u201d. Neon are seeking funding <a href=\"http://goo.gl/ifFFJ\">via Kick Starter</a> to \u201ccontinue and speed up development\u201d. They hope to release Neon via Github by Mid-2013. They also have <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/7004/neon-server-control-panel-for-websites-administrators/p1\">a thread</a> on LowEndTalk.<br>\n<span id=\"more-3422\"></span></p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/prometeus_iperweb.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/prometeus_iperweb.jpg.webp\" alt=\"neon\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> IperWeb Roundup</h3><p><strong>A collection of news from IperWeb.</strong></p><p>It\u2019s been an exciting month for Prometeus; for the second time, on the trot, they won our Top Providers poll!
