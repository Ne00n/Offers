I am still away and will be back home in a week \u2014 which means (1) what I can research on this post might be limited, due to poor 3G/HSPA connection I\u2019ve got (2) I won\u2019t be able to post that many offers (3) I won\u2019t be able to participate much here and on LowEndTalk.

However \u201cLegend\u201d tried to cover it up by claiming to have deleted the site carelessly, and gave out promo code for pre-ordering services that never turned up.

Even on WHT gnzhost\u2019s last post was in November last year. Maybe the service has long gone? Again, WHOIS privacy = no accountability, which I might as well assume it would soon fail at the end.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"/media/images/hostrail.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\" alt=\"HostRail\"> HostRail</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP not resolving</p><p>Okay.
