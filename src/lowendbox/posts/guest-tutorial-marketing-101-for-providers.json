As he observed, \u201cgenerally speaking, hosts have zero clue on how to sell.\u201d While this not true of all hosts (as his article illustrates), it is definitely true that many hosts are more comfortable configuring servers than they are handling the commercial side of their businesses.&nbsp; In the long run, it\u2019s those who master making customer connections and getting their marketing message across who survive.</em></p><p><em>With @SirFoxy\u2019s permission, we\u2019re reprinting this excellent article.&nbsp; It\u2019s been gently reformatted for LEB.&nbsp; While we don\u2019t endorse every point and opinion he shares, he does make many solid points and it\u2019s a fantastic read summary someone with some solid marketing chops.&nbsp; If you\u2019re a host who are trying to feel your way in a very crowded marketplace, it\u2019s mandatory reading!</em></p><hr><p>Generally speaking, hosts have zero clue on how to sell, so rather than making a tutorial about how to secure your KVM, I\u2019m making a tutorial on how to sell.</p><p>Let\u2019s dive in:</p><p><strong>1) You\u2019re a human.&nbsp; Your customers are humans.</strong></p><p>At the end of the day, when you communicate you need to communicate as a human, not a business. you need to show emotion People like <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/seriesn\" rel=\"nofollow\">@seriesn</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nexusbytes.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"NexusBytes\">NexusBytes</a> do this well.&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/173191/na-na-na-na-batmania-hanging-from-down-and-under-some-koality-stuff-inside\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"LowEndTalk\">Example offer</a>).</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/racknerd-cult-360.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27979 alignleft litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/racknerd-cult-360.gif\" alt=\"racknerd cult\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" data-was-processed=\"true\"><strong>2) Create a cult.</strong></p><p>People believe in you and your cause.&nbsp; People meme <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/dustinc\" rel=\"nofollow\">@dustinc</a> (RackNerd CEO) for good reason, because he\u2019s created a cult like following.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter he had an exit scam in the past.&nbsp; People have totally forgot about it because of his cult-like following.&nbsp; He also saves face a lot, and I think he\u2019d do better if he showed more humanistic characteristics rather than being overly professional.&nbsp; Which leads me to my next point\u2026</p><p><strong>3) Create a spectacle.</strong></p><p>Thus brings <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/cociu\" rel=\"nofollow\">@cociu</a> \u2014 he\u2019s overly humanistic, that\u2019s why people wish him doing well.&nbsp; They\u2019ve bonded with him.&nbsp; It\u2019s the trump effect, controversy brings eyes and if you\u2019ve ever heard \u201call publicity is good publicity\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s somewhat true.</p><p>You\u2019ll attract people who don\u2019t like you, but you\u2019ll also bring people who do like you and will buy your services.</p><p><span id=\"more-27978\"></span></p><p><strong>4) Create a USP (Unique Selling Proposition).</strong></p><p>With good copy, good marketing, and good sales, you don\u2019t need to race to the bottom of the barrel.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at OVH for example.&nbsp; Relatively budget service, but provides some of the best DDoS protection for the price.&nbsp; That\u2019s a USP.</p><p>Alternatively, you don\u2019t even necessarily need a USP.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/seriesn\" rel=\"nofollow\">@seriesn</a> provides a sense of humanity and people bond with him and will buy his services even though he\u2019s ultimately a reseller.</p><p><strong>5) Social status, testimonials.</strong></p><p>Here brings <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/Francisco\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Francisco</a> \u2014 he runs a solid service, not too cheap not too expensive. Not a great service, but not bad. Down time every now and then, but he has social status and testimonials.</p><p>Usually he doesn\u2019t get emotional and let\u2019s his service talk for itself.&nbsp; He\u2019s been around long enough to acquire the social status and testimonials to let his service talk for itself.</p><p>Once you build your name and brand up to a certain point you don\u2019t have to do as much.&nbsp; People already have a feel for your character.</p><p>Of course he has value adds, such as DirectAdmin, Blesta, etc, but at the end of the day people buy from <a href=\"https://www.buyvm.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BuyVM</a> not for the best service, but because he has social status and testimonials, and ultimately you know he\u2019ll be around.</p><p><strong>6) LET is not the best source for sales.&nbsp; It\u2019s the best source for eyes.</strong></p><p>You shouldn\u2019t rely on any platform for sales.&nbsp; You should solely rely on it for publicity.</p><p>Only rely on what you can control. SEO is somewhat valuable, but Google could slap you down at anytime and fuck Bing.</p><p>Build an email list. Get eyes on your offers.&nbsp; Get emails. you\u2019ll own that email list forever.</p><p><strong>7) Loss leaders AKA trip wires.</strong></p><p>In the marketing game, loss leaders are referred to as trip wires.</p><p>That $0.01 for the first year shared hosting offer with a renewal of $47 will do you wonders.</p><p>This contradicts my previous point of racing to the bottom, but the point isn\u2019t to price your services low, it\u2019s to introduce people skeptical of your service with as little resistance as possible.</p><p>Set the introduction low, but let them blatantly know it will renew at X amount.&nbsp; For cold audiences this will work wonders, particularly if you have an upsell.</p><p>If you can master this you can expand outside of LET and actually run paid advertising.</p><p>And that\u2019s an end to this for now, I could go on, but this covers a decent amount of bases.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks, @SirFoxy!&nbsp; Do you have an opinion, rant, or tutorial you\u2019d like to share with the world?&nbsp; Please <a href=\"https://lowendbox.freshdesk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact us</a> and we\u2019ll make it happen!</em></p><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/lowendboxtv-weekend-update-for-august-7-2021/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Weekend Update\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210807-lebtv-wu-tn-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">LowEndBoxTV Weekend Update for August 7, 2021</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/provider-911-why-arent-you-selling-on-ebay/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Provider 911\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Provider-911-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Provider 911: Why Aren't You Selling on eBay?</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/provider-911-tricks-of-the-lowend-marketing-masters/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Provider 911\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Provider-911-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Provider 911: Tricks of the LowEnd Marketing Masters</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/advertise-with-lowendbox-and-lowendtalk-2/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Advertise with LowEndBox and LowEndTalk!\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lowendbox_promo-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Advertise with LowEndBox and LowEndTalk!</div></div></a></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/raindog308/\" title=\"All posts by raindog308\" rel=\"author\">raindog308</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/raindog308\" class=\"bio-icon bio-icon-website\"></a><p class=\"bio-description\">I'm Andrew, techno polymath and long-time LowEndTalk community Moderator.
