While this is a relatively new offering so to speak, the LowEndBox staff are working to get in touch with more hosting providers that offer this product to encourage them to create exclusive LEB deals for our readers to enjoy. However, this still leaves the question that some of our readers may be wondering: What is a Hybrid Server? This article, contributed by the folks at </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, explains in detail what a hybrid server is, the benefits of a hybrid server, and some example use cases that a hybrid server might be a great fit for.</span></p><p>Read more to continue\u2026</p><p><span id=\"more-22204\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hybrid server is a relatively new type of hosting that combines the power you\u2019d typically expect with a traditional dedicated server, along with the flexibility of cloud computing features. With hybrid servers, you still receive 100% of the allocated resources (fully dedicated resources), yet the price is lower than traditional dedicated servers, plus you take advantage of cloud virtualization features including but not limited to: instant activation, automatic OS reinstallation\u2019s, scale up at any time, control panel with reboot, stop, boot, vnc, rescue, power off, logs and additional features.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtualization means separation of resources from a physical system. With a hybrid server, you receive a fraction of a physical host, and leverage the pre-existing physical components of a dedicated server. As you can already start to realize, a hybrid server is based on the concept similar to a VPS but it\u2019s split into larger portions that deliver higher performance and more resources at a lower price (higher value).</span></p><p><b>Benefits of a Hybrid Server:</b></p><ul><li><b>Better Performance, Larger Resources<br>\n</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As hybrid servers consist of dedicated resources, they tend to provide better performance than you\u2019d expect from a regular VPS. Also, most hybrid servers consist of at least 4 GB of RAM and up, with generous amounts of disk storage and bandwidth similar to what you\u2019d expect with a dedicated server. This means that if your website or application is outgrowing a VPS environment, you may want to consider upgrading to a hybrid server hosting solution.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Great Security and Redundancy</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hybrid server has less tenants on an underlying host node. Generally speaking, you will benefit from more security and accessibility than you would receive from a regular public cloud environment. With a hybrid server, you leverage the provider\u2019s pre-existing infrastructure design as well (for example, in most cases with RAID-10, and high performing disks \u2014 whereas with a dedicated server on your own, this would only increase cost). Most hosting providers design their nodes like this naturally in order to provide an excellent service and to make it as lucrative, yet as cost-competitive as possible.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Like a Dedicated Server, Without The Cost</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hybrid server acts like a dedicated server (with its own dedicated CPU, memory, storage allocations) except at a lower cost as you are leveraging pre-existing physical components of an already-deployed host server within a datacenter.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Scalability Features</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hybrid server provides more scalability than you would expect with a regular dedicated server. This is thanks to its virtualized nature \u2013 it allows for cloud-like features such as migrations between different physical host nodes, server resource allocation changes, and more on the fly.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Closing Thoughts</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to see why a hybrid server is an excellent choice for hosting websites, gameservers, CMS\u2019s, eCommerce sites, databases, file storage, and more. It\u2019s also useful for development use purposes, as the cloud-like (virtualization) features allow for you to re-install the server\u2019s operating system at any time \u2014 whereas with a standard dedicated server, it would be a more manual and time-consuming task to reinstall the server by hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Looking for a Hybrid Server? </b>Check out <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/?s=hybrid&amp;searchsubmit=Find\">past offers on Low End Box</a> that featured Hybrid Servers or <a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who contributed this informative article/guide to our community provides this type of new hosting service.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Have you used a hybrid server before?
