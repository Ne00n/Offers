This is our second \u2018Community Roundup\u2019, I would like to thank everyone for their nice comments on <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/community-roundup-october-2012/\">October\u2019s edition</a>. If you have any news for our upcoming December edition, or have any suggestions on ways we could improve this feature, you can contact me on liam@lowendbox.com.

The initial release will only support OpenVZ, however in the future both XEN and KVM will also be supported.</p><p>One of CVM\u2019s main focuses is on simplicity: it is designed to have a clean and simple interface, with an intuitive user interface that can be easily customized with your own theme. Another key feature is security, CVM will be using PDO, SSH-based master/slave communication with full logging, slow password hashing with existing and proven algorithms, as well as some other measures. For added security, administrator and user APIs will also be separated.<br>\nThe panel will be free as in cost: the entire codebase will be available entirely for free, without any catches. You won\u2019t even need to provide an email address or make an account. You\u2019ll be allowed to do whatever you want with the code, including, but not limited to, redistribution, modification or resale. Unlike other VPS panels, CVM will not be \u2018Ioncube-encoded\u2019 and the code will not be obfuscated \u2013 all the code will be fully viewable and readable. The panel will be well-documented: with full API documentation and documentation of concepts, underlying technology, and aspects of the supported virtualization technologies.<span id=\"more-3194\"></span></p><p><a href=\"http://cvm.cryto.net/images/screenshots/\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cvm2-300x120.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" title=\"cvm2\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cvm2-300x120.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"120\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></a> You can see some screenshots of CVM by clicking on the image on the right or by clicking <a href=\"http://cvm.cryto.net/images/screenshots/\">here</a>. Whilst the panel is free, and not a commercial project, if you\u2019ve been impressed and would like to give something back, joepie91 is accepting donations.

In Dallas, they\u2019re with, the very popular, Incero. They publicly launched their new location with a awesome little promotion titled <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/5904/catalyst-host-2gb-ovz-for-7-and-new-dallas-location-time-to-move-from-chicago\">\u2018nomorechicago\u2019</a>, which took a friendly jab at ChicagoVPS by offering the same specifications of Chicago\u2019s famous 2048mb plan, and at the same cost, to the first ten customers. The Texas location offers the same plans as Catalyst\u2019s already established Lenoir, North Carolina location.</p><p>Jarland also commented that they\u2019ve decided to push their Denver, Colorado location behind the curtain a bit as \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth advertising anymore, but it\u2019s still there for anyone who finds that it meets their needs\u201d.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rage4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rage4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"rage4\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> Rage4</h3><p><strong>Rage4 partners with Prometeus</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rage4.com\">Rage4</a>, a DNS service created by GBSHouse, have announced via a <a href=\"http://www.rage4.com/blog/?t=6\">press-release</a>, on their website, that they\u2019ve partnered with, much loved, LowEndBox hosting provider: Prometeus. As part of the partnership, Prometeus\u2019s clients will get access to the Rage4 DNS service and GBSHouse will expand the Rage4 network to Milan, Italy.</p><p>Rage4, who were featured on our last Community Roundup, are a relatively new DNS service which works on a pay-as-you-go billing model, meaning that users only pay for real usage. Every domain, which uses Rage4, receives 250,000 free requests per month. Rage4 operate an extensive anycast network for their simple to use service which also comes with many interesting, and innovative, features such as: Failover support, Monitoring, Geo DNS and an extensive API.</p><p>Peter Ginalski, CTO and founder of GBSHouse, commented \u201cPrometeus offer solid and reliable services to an ever-increasing client base around the world. We look forward to providing global DNS hosting to their customers.\u201d</p><p>UPDATE: Peter informs us that Rage4 has, within the last week, also added Australia to their global anycast network.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDIwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/media/images/chicagovps.jpg\" alt=\"ChicagoVPS\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"> ChicagoVPS</h3><p><strong>ChicagoVPS expand to Los Angeles, California</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.chicagovps.net/\">ChicagoVPS</a> are now offering VPS servers in Los Angeles, California. They previously only provided virtual servers in Buffalo, New York and Chicago, Illinois. The west coast location will enable ChicagoVPS to provide a better service for their Asian and Australasian based clientele. It should also increase performance, most notably speed, for their American customers which are located on the west coast.</p><p>As part of the launch proceedings, last Sunday, Chris offered a limited number of their popular 2048MB plans for only $30 per year ($2.50 per month). These plans normally retail at $7 per month which many consider already to be astronomically cheap and thus the promotion sold out very quickly.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDIwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/flipperhost.jpg.webp\" alt=\"flipperhost\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"> Flipper Host</h3><p><strong>FlipperHost expand to Los Angeles, California</strong></p><p>There must be a thing on people expanding to Los Angeles this month, <a href=\"http://www.flipperhost.com/\">FlipperHost</a> have expanded their choice of vps locations to now include Los Angeles, California.

Remember to send me in your news for our December issue! Now that we\u2019ve entered December, Christmas is fast approaching for those of us in the western world.
