It was a DDoS (<em>yes, <a href=\"/blog/ddosed-again-both-lowendbox-and-lowendtalk-affected/\">again</a>!</em>) and the VPS required a reboot to get back to shape. LowEndBox.com availability issues can be discussed <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/282/leb-down-/p1\">on LowEndTalk</a>.</p><p>And yes. I am here to confess that I <b>missed</b> last month\u2019s dead pool post. I did <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/158/august-2011-dead-pool-discussion\">raised it in the forums</a>, but forgot about it after the first week of September. I am also apologising for my lack of involvement here and at LowEndTalk (that site has pretty much been set and forget for me, unfortunately). Things have been busy\u2026</p><p>Anyway. Besides the legendary Steve Jobs, let\u2019s see who else are in the dead pool.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/curlhost2.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/curlhost2.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" alt=\"CurlHost\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> CurlHost</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Connection timed out</p><p><a href=\"/tag/curlhost-com/\"><b>CurlHost</b></a> was <a href=\"/blog/curlhost-2-64mb-openvz-vps/\">first listed</a> in September 2010 offering $2 64MB OpenVZ VPS. Later in October they started selling Xen VPS, and their last offer, a LowEndBox special, was <a href=\"/blog/curlhost-6-50-512mb-xen-hvm-vps-in-seattle/\">posted in April this year</a> offering Xen HVM with 512MB for $6.50. However from the last few comments here + <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1077961\">comments</a> <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1081963\">on WHT</a>, it looks like \u201cPrakash Shrivastav\u201d had done a runner.</p><p>Interestingly Francisco from BuyVM warned me about them back in October last year, and I\u2019m surprised that they have lasted that long.</p><p><span id=\"more-2169\"></span></p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/edgevps.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/edgevps.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" alt=\"EdgeVPS\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> EdgeVPS</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Sold to ThunderCloudGames</p><p>So Travis, a few weeks after selling <a href=\"/blog/hostladder-openvz-kansas-city/\">HostLadder</a>, started up <a href=\"/tag/edgevps-com/\">EdgeVPS</a>, who was about to have <a href=\"/blog/edgevps-6-512mb-openvz-vps-in-asheville/#comment-30411\">\u201ca great run with it\u201d</a>, and had <a href=\"/blog/edgevps-6-512mb-openvz-vps-in-asheville/#comment-30507\">hoped to be the next BuyVM</a>. Well, a few months down the track, EdgeVPS was sold to ThunderCloudGames, which is a division of CyberLynk Network, Inc. This kind of pump-and-run seems to be quite common on LowEndBox \u2014 build a large customer base with low price, sell it to some other company, and then restart the process again. Pretty much fitting into Daniel\u2019s description of Travis <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/2084#Comment_2084\">here</a>.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/myresellerhost.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/myresellerhost.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" alt=\"MyResellerHost\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> MyResellerHost</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: IP address not resolvable</p><p><a href=\"/blog/myresellerhost-5-09-1024mb-openvz-vps-in-germany/\"><b>MyResellerHost</b></a> was first listed on LowEndBox in March this year, although <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpammesberger\">Mark Pammesberger</a> emailed me in December 2010 pretending to be a customer of MyResellerHost. Their first offer came with <em>250GB</em> of storage at $5.09/month, but surely that\u2019s not sustainable (evidently from all the complaint comments rolling in). They then had a hard drive crash in August, and finally <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=268074969879153&amp;id=179897452030239\">closing its shop</a> in September.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/pluggr.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/pluggr.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" alt=\"Pluggr.info\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> Pluggr.info</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Domain expired</p><p><a href=\"/blog/pluggr-info-4-50month-sheevaplug-dedicated-server-140-setup/\"><b>Pluggr.info</b></a> was posted last October as an interesting alternative to low end VPS. Instead of getting a small share of a big iron, you pay $4.50/month for a SheevaPlug dedicated server with a external hard drive attached to it. It did receive some good responses\u2026 However, as far as I know, Alex has moved on from KWD Services to form <a href=\"http://plugbucket.net/\">PlugBucket</a>, and the domain \u201cpluggr.info\u201d has just expired. No idea what happened, but I hope those who got the plug there still have the service.</p><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/tropichost.jpg\" data-src=\"/media/images/tropichost.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" alt=\"TropicHost.info\" data-was-processed=\"true\"> TropicHost</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Under construction</p><p><a href=\"/blog/tropichost-15-903-months-128mb-openvz-vps/\"><b>TropicHost</b></a> should have died <a href=\"/blog/deadpool-june-2011/\">back in June</a> when its website shows just a directory index page.

Maybe, but I guess whatever touched by Lyron Fosters is determined to fail anyway.</p><h3>Not So Honorable Mentions</h3><p>There are still a few VPS providers that I have not yet been able to identify whether there\u2019s any vital sign. To many they are pretty much dead, but (1) they still have their website/ordering system running (2) there are still people claiming that their servers are working. So</p><ul><li><a href=\"/tag/ipap-co/\"><b>iPAP.co</b></a> \u2014 dead? Some people are still having their free VPS that iPAP have not bothered to invoice.
