There are companies with unused /8 blocked, that eventually would be revoked. Spam networks would eventually be forced to give up their allocation as well. At the same time, bigger players such as Amazon and Azure are also investing heavily and stocking up.</p><p>While IPv6 is the future, that future is quite far away.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2099/02/racknerd_150.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26500 alignleft litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2099/02/racknerd_150.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"20\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dustin Cisneros, CEO of <a href=\"https://my.racknerd.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RackNerd</a></strong></p><p>I\u2019ve always been a firm believer that there\u2019s plenty of IPv4 space available in the market place (despite what the media/news portrays), and to this day, we have access to large amounts of IPv4 addresses like never before. While it is true that certain RIR\u2019s have stopped issuing new allocations, there is also an abundance of aftermarket activity, as well as existing ISP\u2019s who have IPv4 allocations that are unused. We leverage our upstream\u2019s, and also cater to customers who are after diversity, and successfully do so. We also leverage partnerships and lease IPv4 through third parties. Our rates are aggressive on IPv4 as a result of our large scale and commitments that we\u2019re able to take on, and as such, we\u2019re able to extend these savings down to our customers.</p><p>Worldwide adoption for IPv6 will continue to be slow. Providers often times recognize this too, and help stimulate the IP economy by leasing out their excess IPv4 space, and/or providing their ranges at aggressive rates.</p><p>For those who are looking for dedicated servers with large IPv4 allocations, i.e. dedicated servers with /24, dedicated servers with 16x /28, or even dedicated servers with 32x /29 IPv4 allocations, RackNerd can accommodate both your diversity and IPv4 requirements at affordable prices!

All regions such as APNIC, ARIN, AfriNIC and RIPE were exhausted by around 2011. Currently there are some hosting companies definitely sitting pretty on large amount of allocations. Other hosts followed the rules and requested only the appropriate amount needed. As of right now (April 2021) the cost per IP address is $28. As allocations are further depleted and hosts are forced to purchase IPv4 on the open market it will inevitably lead to the cost of a VPS to increase. On the flip side its quite possibly that the cost of a VPS with IPv6 ONLY could go down to offset the increase associated with IPv4. InterServer is considering offering a discount to customers that opt out of ipv4 when ordering a VPS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Thank you to all of our providers for participating this month!</p><p>If <strong>you</strong> have a question you\u2019d like to put to the round table, <a href=\"https://lowendbox.freshdesk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">please submit it to us</a>!</p><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/community-news-almalinux-os-now-available-on-racknerds-platform/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Community News: AlmaLinux OS Now Available on RackNerd's Platform!\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/almalinux-vps-150x150.jpeg) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Community News: AlmaLinux OS Now Available on RackNerd's Platform!</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-mike-larvik-director-of-business-development-for-interserver/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Interview: Q&amp;A with Mike Larvik, Director of Business Development for Interserver\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/interserver-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Interview: Q&amp;A with Mike Larvik, Director of Business Development for Interserver</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/stop-the-presses-nexusbytes-launches-a-new-budget-line-entrybytes/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Stop the Presses!
