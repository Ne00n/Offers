Cisneros from </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a seasoned and knowledgeable contributor of the hosting industry for 12+ years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>What is Reseller Hosting?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reseller Hosting is a form of web hosting whereby the account owner has the ability to create sub-accounts with his or her allocated resources (storage, bandwidth, number of sub-accounts). The reseller can then sell hosting accounts to customers and friends. Generally, the resellers end-users will have their own private control panel login credentials provided by the reseller.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-22477\"></span></p><p><b>How does Reseller Hosting work?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, and before 2020, 99% of the Reseller Hosting offers that existed in the marketplace were powered by a control panel you may have heard of before: cPanel/WHM. cPanel/WHM is a well-known control panel, with decades of development track record behind it. This is why many hosting providers and consumers alike prefer running cPanel/WHM software on their servers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 marks a year of a lot of hosting providers ceasing or changing their cPanel/WHM based reseller hosting services because of the </span><a href=\"https://blog.cpanel.com/account-based-pricing-updates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cPanel price increases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which was of much controversy on the Internet). The price increases enforced by cPanel on the corporate level resulted in price increases of the software licensing, to the tune of 25% to 500% for hosting providers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, hosting providers were able to receive a cPanel license which allowed for unlimited account creations on the server for one flat monthly fee. The new structure is billed monthly on a per-account basis. You can quickly see how bad this situation can turn out, for hosting providers who provided unsustainable offers with unlimited accounts.</span></p><p><b>The result? </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of providers were forced to entirely switch off cPanel\u2019s platform and moved over to an alternative platform such as DirectAdmin. On the other hand, some providers have raised their prices to make up for the increased licensing costs, while continuing to offer cPanel/WHM based services.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the noise, you might still be considering a cPanel/WHM reseller account for the simple fact that end-users prefer the control panel interface they already know and love. This can result in easier conversations with your customers, and overall a simplified experience that could result in more sales.</span></p><p><b>NOTE: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you see a web hosting provider offering reseller accounts powered by cPanel/WHM with unlimited account creations, it\u2019s probably a red flag that the hosting provider hasn\u2019t updated their offerings to sustainable packages, or that you are looking at an expired offer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchasing with a hosting provider who sells sustainable packages ensures the long term longevity of their business, and as such, your uptime.</span></p><p><b>Getting Started with Reseller Hosting</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you looking to start a business? Starting a business helping friends, businesses and such with their online presence can result in recurring money! A reseller hosting account is the best way to start. With a reseller hosting account, you can either create hosting accounts for your own websites/domains, or resell the space to your customers. Thus, in short, it offers you benefits of low maintenance, better control, and income generation, all without having to worry about maintaining and managing your own server.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to decide whether you want to go with a web hosting provider that offers reseller accounts based on cPanel/WHM, or based on DirectAdmin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll naturally find that the DirectAdmin offerings are much more cost-effective since they still offer flat-rate server licensing to web hosts for the time being. As such, DirectAdmin web hosting providers are able to shave some more costs down to you, the customer. It\u2019s purely a business decision for you now to decide whether you want to risk losing potential opportunities or potential customers because you are not using a control panel they are already familiar with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that cPanel/WHM is the king in popularity among the control panels, and is a panel that even beginners have used at some point before. This can be a huge advantage, as your offers will better resonate with your audience/customers. Therefore, while a cPanel/WHM based reseller may be slightly more expensive, and come with limitations to the amount of accounts you can create on a package, the extra few dollars you spend may go a long way in winning sales, and long term customers for your business.\u2019</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more due diligence item to watch out for is to check and ask your reseller hosting provider if their servers are Whitelabel. This way, you can sell hosting services to your customers without them knowing who the hosting provider is, rather all they\u2019d see is the upstream datacenter.</span></p><p><b>Looking for a cPanel reseller account?</b> <a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who contributed this article to the community, is providing a special discount for the LowEndBox community.
