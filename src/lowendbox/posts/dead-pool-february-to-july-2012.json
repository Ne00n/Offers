They later <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/vmport-4-70month-512mb-openvz-in-us-uk-germany/\">expanded to further locations and toyed around with XEN</a>. Vmport even started a short-lived kvm subsidiary called kvmport, but after facing many problems with their provider, they were forced to cease kvm operations. After this, vmport tried to refocus on offering KVM vps servers in England, but this proved to be in vein after other sides of the business dragged this profitable section down.</p><p>On May 2012, <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1154678\">FTN Hosting announced they had acquired vmport</a> and that it would be migrating vmport\u2019s existing infrastructure to FTNHosting\u2019s fully owned equipment. The previous owner of VMport, Ashley, subsequently launched another company \u2018GetKVM\u2019 which would focus on the profitable KVM side of the industry.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" class=\"screenshot\" data-src=\"/media/images/vpsone.jpg\" alt=\"vpsone\"> VpsOne</h3><p><strong>Current Status</strong>: IP address not resolvable</p><p>Canadian based Vpsone, appeared on lowendbox in July 2010 with a <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/vpsone-5-128mb-openvz-vps/\">$5 128mb Ram offer</a>.
