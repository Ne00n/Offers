I have decided to try and reboot that, however this time incorporating a mixture of LEB and LET. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have anything interesting that you would like to share on this Community Roundup (which will be appearing every Sunday evening), then just leave a comment on this post and I will look through them all next week and pick out a few of the best items for the next edition. Also, I will be scouring LEB and LET for interesting news and stories.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-8930\"></span></p><h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LowEndBox New Offer Guidelines</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of a plan to try and get new providers over on both the forums, and posting on LowEndBox, the decision has been taken in order to change the pricing guidelines. Full information on this is on </span><a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/89726/lowendbox-new-offers-guidelines/p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/89726/lowendbox-new-offers-guidelines/p1</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 but to summarise it:</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td><b>Old price/rule</b></td><td><b>New price/rule (per month)</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Unmanaged VPS</b></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$7</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Shared hosting</b></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N/A</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.50</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Reseller hosting</b></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N/A</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$5</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>VPN</b></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N/A</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$7</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Domains</b><p></p><p><b>Common TLDs:</b></p><p><b>Speciality TLDs:</b></p></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N/A</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$6 (per year)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 (per year)</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Managed VPS</b></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N/A</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$30</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Unmanaged dedicated servers</b></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$49</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$50</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Managed dedicated servers</b></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N/A</span></td><td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$150</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, the most prominent change is the increase of the infamous $7 a month VPS cap to $10. This should prove very interesting, and I hope that this will produce some interesting offers. If you see anything that catches your eye, feel free to post it in the comments and it may be featured in next week\u2019s Community Roundup.&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DigitalOcean Introduces Charges for Snapshots</span></h1><p><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-8936\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8936 size-full error\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16.png\" alt=\"digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16\" width=\"653\" height=\"739\" data-srcset=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16.png 653w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16-265x300.png 265w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" srcset=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16.png 653w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digital-ocean-snapshots-charges-8-21-16-265x300.png 265w\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></a></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/89732/digital-ocean-to-begin-charging-for-snapshots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/89732/digital-ocean-to-begin-charging-for-snapshots</a></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We start this week, with some news from one of LE\u2019s biggest stalwarts, DigitalOcean. Although they may not be truly low end, they are still a provider that is used and respected by many in the LowEnd area. Their smallest VPSes fit perfectly within the $7 price range. I often see people who have started their projects at DigitalOcean, and are now looking to expand. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DigitalOcean started to allow users to create snapshots in the middle of 2012, and was a feature that had been heavily requested and DigitalOcean were very proud to release. Snapshots are where a user elects to take a full system state copy of their VM, which DO then store on separate hardware. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this week they announced that they were going to start charging for their snapshot service. This has been to the horror of many LowEndBox users who have been very passionately. Since the beginning, DigitalOcean had stated that they were going to charge but for the past 2 years they have not been doing so. This will all change on October 1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when they will start charging for storage at $0.05 per gigabyte per month. This has come to a blow to many people, who were not expecting DigitalOcean to start charging, and had been using it like it was free forever. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a user with a $5 a month VM, which had fully maxed out its disk space, this means that the user would be paying 0.05 (price 1 GB of storage, per month) x 20 (the cheapest plan has 20GB of SSD space) which equals 1 dollar a month. In my opinion, this is very respectable. A dollar a month for peace of mind that you have a secure copy of your VM that is stored externally. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to counteract this though, DigitalOcean stated that \u201clive snapshots\u201d were now something that can be done. This means that users can now take snapshots without having to turn their VM\u2019s off. This alone, I feel, makes up for the dollar fee. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, they encourage all users to check their snapshot usage (which can be done on the Snapshot page of their panel) and to delete any unused snapshots in order to avoid any unexpected charges. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thread on LET had attracted quite a number of suggestions that Digital Ocean should allow users to download their own snapshots to avoid the storage fees. This is something that DigitalOcean are now looking into, and considering. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is really nice to see such a large provider like DigitalOcean doing so much and listening/responding to the community.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Providers:</span></h1><ol><li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BudgetNode launched recently, and are getting very good reviews from the community.
