Looking back I have posted over 30 low end offers since the beginning of this month. A bit excessive I found. Not to mention the amount of time spent on background checks and posting the actual offers. And who knows how many of them are just going to do a \u201cBen Harper\u201d of RackVM?</p><p>Not to mention LowEndBox <em>was supposed</em> to be my \u201cspare time\u201d hobby. Unfortunately my \u201cspare time\u201d has been scarce lately due to some up-coming changes in life. As you can see I really do not have time to post every offer people threw at me. I also hate to see LowEndBox becoming <em>\u201cjust a cheap advertisement platform\u201d</em> for the budget hosting providers \u2014 although I think it might have already been the case.</p><p>Therefore I am going to make some changes here. I will <b>reduce</b> the frequency of posts, and <b>tighten up</b> the criteria.</p><ol><li>I will not post new offers from providers which I have previously posted over the last <b>30 days</b>. Those weekly \u201creminder emails\u201d are getting really annoying. Unless it is an exceptionally good offer \u2014 but I\u2019ll be the judge on what is \u201cexceptional\u201d.</li><li>I will not accept annual payment offers from providers that have been around for less than one year. How can I have any confident that you will finish year 2, when you are still stuck in year 1? I will use domain age as an indicator.</li><li>Annual payment threshold is now capped at <b>$60/year</b> (~$5/month). People should expect appropriate discount if they are asked to pay for the whole year upfront.</li></ol><p>And sorry for those who have already emailed me asking to be \u201cfeatured\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t really have time to respond to all of you. If you don\u2019t fit the criteria, your request might be silently ignored.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ftoo-many-offers-on-lowendbox%2F&amp;t=Too%20Many%20%22Offers%22%20on%20LowEndBox%3F\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Too%20Many%20%22Offers%22%20on%20LowEndBox%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ftoo-many-offers-on-lowendbox%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Ftoo-many-offers-on-lowendbox%2F&amp;title=Too%20Many%20%22Offers%22%20on%20LowEndBox%3F&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
