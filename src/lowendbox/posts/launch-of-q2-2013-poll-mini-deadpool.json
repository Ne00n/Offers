For those unfamiliar with our top providers poll, it\u2019s a chance for the community to showcase and vote for the best provider. We have ran these polls on and off for for the past few years. Prometeus have came first on the last three occasions. It will be interesting to see how the rankings change.</p><p>Unfortunately our wiki is currently down, will be back up this week, so you cannot see the previous results easily. You can however see some of the results by viewing <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/tag/top-providers/\">these threads</a> on LowEndBox. Good luck to all!<br>\n<span id=\"more-4069\"></span><br>\n<u>Mini DeadPool</u>:</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/images/fibervolt2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"/media/images/fibervolt2.jpg\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" alt=\"FiberVolt\" data-was-processed=\"true\">Fiber Volt</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: None responsive</p><p><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/tag/fibervolt-com/\"><b>FiberVolt</b></a> first appeared on LowEndBox in April 2011 offering a $5.53 256MB OpenVZ VPS in San Diego. Alex from San Diego and Victor from Melbourne Australia appeared to be running the show. They went on to be featured an additional 5 times. Only last June, we <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/review-fiber-volt-256-mb-openvz-monthly/\">wrote a review</a> on their service. In it we noted that overall they were a good host, with decent performance and quick support. FiberVolt were known for their beautiful website and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/fibervolt-2/id611730986?l=en&amp;mt=8\">iphone app</a>.</p><p>In june, customers began reporting that that the company had gone \u2018bellyup\u2019. Even though their website is up, customers have not been able to contact them for a while.</p><hr><h3><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/betavps.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/betavps.png.webp\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" alt=\"BetaVPS\" data-was-processed=\"true\">BetaVPS</h3><p><b>Current Status</b>: Website Parked / Everything down</p><p><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/tag/betavps-net/\"><b>BetaVPS</b></a> were featured once on LowEndBox offering a <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/betavps-5-monthly-1024mb-ram-openvz-in-canada-and-germany/\">$5 Monthly 1024MB RAM OpenVZ VPS in Canada and Germany</a>. Despite my better judgement, and concern over the use of Dos in their name, I went ahead and posted that offer in February. Reviews from the start were just terrible. When Daniel sent in another offer a month later, we ignored it.</p><p>In April/May they went down for good.</p><hr><p>Compared with the olden days, we do not seem to be getting as many deadpools. If we have missed anyone, we are deeply sorry! I\u2019ve searched extensively on both here and on LowEndTalk to find hosts which have entered the deadpool. It is possible one of the older hosts could have entered without it being reported. We are working on a script to monitor hosts who we feature on here. This should alert us to activities suggesting that they may have deadpooled.</p><p>That\u2019s it for now. We have a few cool things up our sleeves which we hope to announce soon.
