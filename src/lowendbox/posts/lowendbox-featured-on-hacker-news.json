One of my <a href=\"/blog/yes-you-can-run-18-static-sites-on-a-64mb-link-1-vps/\">two year old article</a> got <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2644338\">featured on Hacker News</a> earlier today. For those who do not know about <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a>, read more about it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News\">on its Wikipedia entry</a>. HN and one of my local news paper are two sites that I usually read first thing in the morning, as it aggregates news concerning startups, technology, programming, etc. Some topics interest me, as I have recently quitted my job to pursuit my startup.</p><p>Anyway. Hacker News is one of more popular tech community. It wasn\u2019t really Slashdot (back in its hey days) nor Digg (its popularity has also been declining), however I think it might still be interesting to see how LowEndBox handled that \u201cspike of traffic\u201d. Remember \u2014 it\u2019s on a 80MB \u201cmicro VPS\u201d <a href=\"/blog/moved-again-to-quickwebmicrovps/\">provided by QuickWeb</a>, running current WordPress stable <b>without</b> any caching plugins.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/pix/loadavg-hackernews.png\" data-src=\"/media/pix/loadavg-hackernews.png\" alt=\"Loadavg after featured on Hacker News\" class=\"litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"/media/pix/traffic-hackernews.png\" data-src=\"/media/pix/traffic-hackernews.png\" alt=\"Traffic after featured on Hacker News\" class=\"litespeed-loaded\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></p><p>Well. Not really <em>spectacular</em>, is it? I counted that only around 5,000 page views over 12 hours. My VPS struggled a little bit (some caching would have helped as it\u2019s hitting one single page), but it survived without too much trouble. Much better than <a href=\"/blog/load-testing-this-blog/\">when someone did a load impact test</a> to DDoS this blog last year. From the discussion on <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2644338\">that Hacker News page</a>, I guess not many people actually visited the site or read the content anyway. Thanks to \u201ccdx\u201d, \u201cjack12\u201d, \u201cdmmcintyre3\u201d, \u201cnl\u201d who have tried to defend me on HN, but let me try to answer some questions here.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/blog/yes-you-can-run-18-static-sites-on-a-64mb-link-1-vps/\">My original article</a> was mocking some of the \u201cexperts\u201d on WebhostingTalk, when someone asked how much memory is needed to host 18 static websites. Obviously it is not literally limited at 18 static sites. With async/event based web servers, on a low end VPS it\u2019s probably going to be limited at disk IO (assuming not enough memory to cache all frequently used files). But if you want to host 10,000 low traffic static sites?! There shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</li><li>My original article then extended to cover not just static file serving, but actually getting a full stack to run WordPress, since it is probably the most popular open source blogging software. In fact the VPS runs LowEndBox.com is not too different (80MB memory, Nginx instead of Lighttpd), and it did ~40,000 WordPress PHP requests yesterday. As I\u2019ve said in the previous point \u2014 number of static websites does not really matter. However, number of full PHP requests on a popular off-the-shelf package would make it a more meaningful comparison (and something can\u2019t be replicated using Amazon S3).</li><li>Pfft. Back in \u201997 when I wrote my first \u201creal world\u201d web app, demoing a library category system written in Perl CGI saving data to BerkeleyDB. Whole backend (Linux, Apache, Perl CGI) plus the front end (X11, Netscape Navigator, no window manager though) run on a 486 DX4-75 laptop with 8MB of memory. But that\u2019s beside the point. I want to focus what you can get out from a 64MB VPS, right now.</li><li>I feel disgusted on how someone would perceive that HN posting as \u201cspam\u201d. I have no idea who \u201ctshtf\u201d is on HN and why he chose to post that 2 year old article. As of the <em>affiliation link</em> being questioned in Hacker News, well<ul><li>The only affiliate link I have ever posted on LowEndBox was for VPSLink, when this site was once hosted there. VPSLink used to provide hosting credit (not redeemable to cash) to their \u201caffiliates\u201d. So I was effectively just trying to reduce my hosting cost \u2014 that was before any banner ads were introduced to this website. That was when Cameron was still running the show in VPSLink.</li><li>VPSLink was then purchased by Endurance International in early 2010, and they have also conveniently forgotten about all my hosting credits. D\u2019oh. Those old \u201caffiliate links\u201d obviously don\u2019t work for me any more. Moreover after having issues with Endurance, I had <a href=\"/blog/temporarily-moved-to-2host-com/\">a series</a> <a href=\"/blog/moved-again-to-quickwebmicrovps/\">of moves</a>. Big thanks to QuickWeb for providing this VPS to me for free to host LowEndBox (<em>and I always need to remember making disclaimers when I post their offers</em>).</li></ul><p>Anyway, I am sure even after a full explanation there will still be people calling \u201cspam\u201d, \u201cshill\u201d or whatever. Quoting one representative of an ex-provider featured here (who is already in deadpool). \u201cHater gonna hates\u201d :)</p></li></ul><p>Guess what? Getting featured on front page of Hacker News and it actually <em>wasn\u2019t really a good experience</em>. Elitist mentality? Simply ignorant? I have no idea. Or did I just waste an hour posting this non-sense rather than another good low end offer?</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flowendbox-featured-on-hacker-news%2F&amp;t=LowEndBox%20Featured%20on%20Hacker%20News\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=LowEndBox%20Featured%20on%20Hacker%20News&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flowendbox-featured-on-hacker-news%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Flowendbox-featured-on-hacker-news%2F&amp;title=LowEndBox%20Featured%20on%20Hacker%20News&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
