I\u2019m using the easiest approach possible on all aspects of this, which gives us plenty of room to improve in the future as well as keeping it easy to understand right now. While I\u2019m writing this as part of a LowEndCluster series, each tutorial in itself has value as well and many of them can be applied to other situations as well. For example, the MariaDB master-slave tutorial and the filesystem one today can be used perfectly fine to keep a spare copy of, say, an existing Observium machine. The only limit is your imagination ;-)</p><p>This week we\u2019re going to install our filesystem, which will be SSHFS-based and we\u2019ll be using rsync to move all the data to the second server. It\u2019s really quite simple to be honest, but very effective! Let\u2019s get cracking!</p><p><span id=\"more-7005\"></span></p><h2>The web node \u2013 Part 1</h2><p>First we\u2019re going to create a user account and SSH keys on one of the web nodes. We\u2019re then going to repeat the user creation and copy the SSH keys to the second web node.</p><p>Let\u2019s create the user first called \u2018cluster\u2019. We\u2019ll use this user to log into the filesystem server:</p><blockquote><p>sudo adduser cluster</p></blockquote><p>You\u2019ll be asked for a password here. Please provide a strong one. You won\u2019t need it further down the road. After you have provided a password, you\u2019ll be answered a number of questions. Feel free to fill those out, but none of them is required.</p><p>Now you\u2019ve got a new user, switch to that user:</p><blockquote><p>sudo su cluster</p></blockquote><p>And go to its home directory:</p><blockquote><p>cd</p></blockquote><p>From the home directory, run the following command to generate an SSH key pair:</p><blockquote><p>ssh-keygen</p></blockquote><p>You\u2019ll again be asked some questions, more specifically a password. Leave this empty and ENTER through it. We don\u2019t want a password as it\u2019s going to give us issues while mounting the remote filesystem.</p><p>Finally, create a directory where we\u2019re going to mount the remote filesystem:</p><blockquote><p>sudo mkdir /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>And ensure the user \u2018cluster\u2019 owns what directory:</p><blockquote><p>sudo chown cluster. /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>So, the situation we have right now is as follows:</p><ul><li>You have a \u2018cluster\u2019 user with a strong password</li><li>You have an SSH key pair for the cluster user without a password</li><li>You have a /filesystem directory own by the user \u2018cluster\u2019 that will function as a mount point in the future</li></ul><p>Repeat the user creation on the second web node, but do not create an SSH key pair there. You should copy the SSH files from your first web node to your second web node:</p><blockquote><p>scp -r .ssh/ node2.example.net:/home/cluster/.ssh</p></blockquote><p>The above command should be run as the user \u2018cluster\u2019 from the first web node. What this does, is copy the .ssh directory and its contents over to the second web node. Both web nodes now have the same SSH key pair, which will eventually give them access to the filesystem node.</p><p>Before we can take that step, though, we\u2019ll head over to the filesystem node.</p><h2>The filesystem node \u2013 Part 1</h2><p>On the first filesystem node node, repeat the user creation step from above:</p><blockquote><p>sudo adduser cluster</p></blockquote><p>Again, pick a strong password. It doesn\u2019t need to match that of the one on the web node. You do need to be able to fill it out later, though.</p><p>Once this has been done, you should create a folder on the filesystem node where you want to put your files:</p><blockquote><p>sudo mkdir /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>This will create a directory called \u2018filesystem\u2019 in the root of your server. Feel free to put it somewhere else, but I\u2019m using this location to keep things simple.</p><p>Now, ensure the user \u2018cluster\u2019 owns what directory:</p><blockquote><p>sudo chown cluster. /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>And you should be good!</p><p>On the filesystem node, you now have the following situation:</p><ul><li>A user \u2018cluster\u2019 with a strong password</li><li>A directory (/filesystem) to host your files owned by the user (and user group) \u2018cluster\u2019</li></ul><p>You should now repeat the above steps on the second filesystem node before you continue.</p><p><em>A short note: initially, I anticipated the need for </em>three<em> filesystem nodes. This is no longer the case. Two will suffice (they don\u2019t have to be KVM either), which means you will have a total of 8 servers: 2 load balancers, 2 web nodes, 2 database nodes, and 2 filesystem nodes. I will elaborate on this in the final notes.</em></p><h2>The web node \u2013 Part 2</h2><p>Back on the web node, you now can copy the public key of the \u2018cluster\u2019 user\u2019s SSH key pair to the filesystem nodes. As the user \u2018cluster\u2019, from the home directory, run:</p><blockquote><p>ssh-copy-id filesystemnode.example.net</p></blockquote><p>Replace filesystemnode.example.net with the hostname of your first filesystem node. You will be asked for a password: use the password you\u2019ve set for the user on the <em>filesystem node</em>! The public SSH key should then be copied. Give this a try by trying to access the filesystem node via SSH:</p><blockquote><p>ssh filesystemnode.example.net</p></blockquote><p>You should now be logged in without it asking for your password. If that is the case, repeat the first step for the second filesystem node:</p><blockquote><p>ssh-copy-id filesystemnode2.example.net</p></blockquote><p>And that should now also have your public SSH key on it.</p><p>So, short recap. Right now, you have:</p><ul><li>Two web nodes with a \u2018cluster\u2019 user sharing the same SSH key pair</li><li>Two filesystem nodes with a \u2018cluster\u2019 user that have the web nodes\u2019 user\u2019s SSH public key in the <em>authorized_keys</em> file</li><li>The ability to access either filesystem node from either web node using SSH without being prompted for a password</li></ul><p>With that in mind, we can now mount the remote filesystem on the web nodes.</p><p>In order to be able to mount the remote filesystem, you need SSHFS installed on your server. For this to work, you need either an OpenVZ box with FUSE enabled, or a KVM machine. Most providers enable FUSE for your on demand; some have it built into their panel. SolusVM does not give users an option to enable/disable FUSE, so if your provider uses SolusVM, please contact them.</p><p>Let\u2019s install SSHFS. On both web nodes, run:</p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install sshfs</p></blockquote><p>With SSHFS installed, you can actually mount the remote filesystem right away. We\u2019ll make it \u201cstick\u201d in a bit, as a mount from the CLI won\u2019t survive a reboot, but it\u2019s good to test it. From one of the web nodes, as the user \u2018cluster\u2019, run:</p><blockquote><p>sshfs filesystemnode.example.net:/filesystem /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>Replace filesystemnode.example.net with the hostname or IP address of your first filesystem node. We\u2019re going to work with the first one from now on, but just when accessing it from the web nodes.</p><p>If this doesn\u2019t give any errors (and it shouldn\u2019t), head over to the /filesystem directory on the web node:</p><blockquote><p>cd /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>And try to create a file there:</p><blockquote><p>touch README.md</p></blockquote><p>With that file having been created, let\u2019s go back to the filesystem node.</p><h2>The filesystem node \u2013 Part 2</h2><p>On the filesystem node, first check if the file you\u2019ve just created from the web node is present:</p><blockquote><p>ls -al /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>In the output, you should see the file \u2018README.md\u2019 listed. Neat, right?</p><p>OK, so now we can use the remote filesystem from the web node, we have a situation which we can work from. Before we start moving WordPress to the remote filesystem, though, I\u2019d like to set up redundancy. I want to make sure that if the first filesystem node is offline, I can easily switch over my web nodes to the second filesystem node and have the same files there.</p><p>I\u2019m going to use rsync for that. This tool should already be installed, but if it isn\u2019t, here\u2019s how you install it:</p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install rsync</p></blockquote><p>And that\u2019s all.</p><p>In order to be able to rsync from the first filesystem node to the second filesystem node, the \u2018cluster\u2019 user on the first filesystem node needs to be able to access the second filesystem node.</p><p>As the cluster user on the first filesystem node, from the home directory of the user, run:</p><blockquote><p>ssh-keygen</p></blockquote><p>Follow the same rule as before: no password.</p><p>Now, copy this over to the second filesystem node:</p><blockquote><p>ssh-copy-id filesystemnode2.example.net</p></blockquote><p>And you should be able to access that no problem, no passwords asked, via SSH.</p><p>Now, back to rsync. It\u2019s actually extremely easy to get this working. From the first web node, run the following command:</p><blockquote><p>rsync -a /filesystem filesystemnode2.example.net:/filesystem</p></blockquote><p>What this does is recursively synchronize all files from the first filesystem node to the second filesystem node.</p><p>The \u2018-a\u2019 flag does a lot of cool things that you want to happen:</p><ul><li>Performs a recursive sync (all directories and files under /filesystem in this case)</li><li>Copies symlinks as actual symlinks</li><li>Preserves permissions</li><li>Preserves modification times</li><li>Preserves the owner and group</li><li>Preserves several other files</li></ul><p>So, this will actually be a copy of the situation as it is on the first filesystem node rather than a half-assed backup.</p><p>But running the command by hand isn\u2019t going to help you any. You want to have this ran on a regular basis. To solve this issue, I want to add the command to cron. Depending on the site of the filesystem and the amount of file modifications you make, I\u2019d say you could run this every 15 minutes for a site with few modifications. Worst-case scenario is you loose 15 minutes of changes to files (<em>not</em> the database). You can change this to fit your needs, but keep in mind that rsync need to have enough time to complete before running it again.</p><p>On the first filesystem node, as the user \u2018cluster\u2019, run:</p><blockquote><p>crontab -e</p></blockquote><p>This will open an editor, or ask you to pick one. If it asks you to pick one, either pick one or press enter. The default is \u2018nano\u2019, which should be easiest for most people.</p><p>In the file that opens, add the following line:</p><blockquote><p>*/15 * * * * rsync -a /filesystem filesystemnode2.example.net:/filesystem</p></blockquote><p>Now save the file. From this point on, rsync should back up the files from the first filesystem node to the second filesystem node every 15 mintes!</p><p>It\u2019s time to head for the final step when it comes to the filesystem: permanently mounting the remote filesystem on the web nodes. Before we start with that, however, let\u2019s do another recap. We now have:</p><ul><li>Two web nodes with access to both filesystem nodes over SSH without needing a password</li><li>SSHFS installed on both web nodes</li><li>Two filesystem nodes with the first one having access to the second one over SSH without the need for a password</li><li>A cron running an rsync command every 15 minutes to back up the files from the first filesystem node to the second filesystem node</li><li>A working situation for mounting the remote filesystem on the web nodes</li></ul><h2>The web node \u2013 Part 3</h2><p>In order to mount the remote filesystem permanently, you need to add an entry to /etc/fstab, which lists the filesystems that should be mounted. In order to be able to mount it, though, you need to be able to log in to the remote filesystem as the user \u2018cluster\u2019 from the user \u2018root\u2019, since root mounts the filesystems at boot. In order to do this, the private SSH key of the \u2018cluster\u2019 user needs to be copied to the .ssh directory of the \u2018root\u2019 user.</p><p>Make yourself root:</p><blockquote><p>sudo su root</p></blockquote><p>And head to your home directory:</p><blockquote><p>cd</p></blockquote><p>From there, run the following command:</p><blockquote><p>cp /home/cluster/.ssh/id_rsa .ssh/</p></blockquote><p>This copies the private key to the root user\u2019s .ssh directory, giving it the ability to log in to the filesystem nodes as the user \u2018cluster\u2019.</p><p>Now, open up /etc/fstab in your favorite editor (I\u2019m using vim):</p><blockquote><p>vim /etc/fstab</p></blockquote><p>And add the following line:</p><blockquote><p>cluster@filesystemnode.example.net:/filesystem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /filesystem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fuse.sshfs&nbsp; defaults,_netdev&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0</p></blockquote><p>Save the file. In order to test this, first unmount your test mount (if you had any):</p><blockquote><p>fusermount -u /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>And then try the fstab file:</p><blockquote><p>mount -a</p></blockquote><p>If there are no errors, you should see the remote filesystem mounted under /filesystem with all your files there. Do this on <em>both</em> web nodes to enable quick switching in case of an issue.</p><p>Once this is done, it\u2019s time for the grand finale step: moving your WordPress files to the remote filesystem!</p><h2>The \u201cbig\u201d migration</h2><p>There\u2019s one last \u2018but\u2019 to this: the web server runs as \u2018www-data\u2019 and needs to be able to access the files owned by cluster. Since all files have user+group access, all you need to do it add the \u2018www-data\u2019 user on both web nodes to the \u2018cluster\u2019 group:</p><blockquote><p>sudo usermod -a -G cluster www-data</p></blockquote><p>This modifies the user \u2018www-data\u2019 and adds it to the group \u2018cluster\u2019.</p><p>Now you can safely migrate your files to the remote filesystem. Since we stored the files in a user\u2019s home directory, we\u2019re going to copy them from there to the /filesystem directory:</p><blockquote><p>sudo cp -rp /home/username/public_html /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>This copies the files recursively from the old location to the new one, preserving ownership and timestamps. After having done that, make sure all files are owned by \u2018cluster\u2019 in order to prevent any issues. Since \u2018www-data\u2019 is in the group \u2018cluster\u2019 this should not be an issue:</p><blockquote><p>sudo chown -R cluster. /filesystem</p></blockquote><p>Finally, with all the files on the remote filesystem, you need to take one more step for this to work: switching the web server to a different document root. Open up the file /etc/nginx/sites-available/hostname.conf and look for this line:</p><blockquote><p>root /home/username/public_html;</p></blockquote><p>Change that to:</p><blockquote><p>root /filesystem;</p></blockquote><p>And restart NGINX:</p><blockquote><p>sudo service nginx restart</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s it! It was quite some work, but you now have your (manual-intervention-required) fully redundant LowEndCluster!</p><h2>Final notes</h2><p>As this is quite an elaborate series, I make make this one into a lengthy guide in the future and/or expand on it. What I\u2019ve done so far it touched the bare essentials of the possibilities and as technology develops, those possibilities will only increase.</p><p>I do need to note, though, that for a high-traffic website this may not be the best solution. Especially not with servers spread across the planet.</p><p>To get back to the required servers, here\u2019s the list of servers I\u2019ve actually used:</p><ul><li>2x BudgetVZ 128MB \u2013 Load balancers with IPv4 and IPv6 \u2013 \u20ac4/year each \u2013 \u20ac8/year total</li><li>2x MegaVZ 512MB \u2013 Database servers with NAT IPv4 and IPv6 \u2013 \u20ac5.5o/year each \u2013 \u20ac11/year total</li><li>2x LowEndSpirit 128MB \u2013 Web nodes with NAT IPv4 and IPv6 \u2013 \u20ac3/year each \u2013 \u20ac6/year total</li><li>2x LowEndSpirit 128MB \u2013 Filesystem nodes with NAT IPv4 and IPv6 \u2013 \u20ac3/year each \u2013 \u20ac6/year total</li></ul><p>It differs from my initial list in that KVM machines are no longer required for the filesystem. OpenVZ with FUSE works fine. This means you can actually create this 8-server cluster for less than $35/year (\u20ac31)! That\u2019s both LowEnd and fantastic!</p><p>I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed reading this series and I look forward to getting back to it in the future.
