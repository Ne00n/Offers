Cisneros, CEO of RackNerd on LinkedIn today, and thought it would be some newsworthy content to share, considering RackNerd is a popular provider within the LowEndBox and LowEndTalk community, with some of the highest engagement rates. RackNerd has frequently contributed content, giveaways, and special deals to the community, and have garnered a reputation for excellent service and support.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just a year after </span><a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/165244/racknerd-office-space-expansion-pictures-share-your-office\" aria-label=\"LowEndTalk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd moved into their first office space in Upland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it looks like RackNerd has already outgrown that office, and is now expanding over to new office space in Rancho Cucamonga, which is truly amazing to see. They are a dominant player here within the community, and we believe that members of the LEB/LET community will also be happy to see and appreciate being with a company that has real office space, based here within the United States. Office space is not the only indicator, but it definitely shows for the provider\u2019s commitment, positive cash flow, and good standing as a company \u2013 as obtaining office space is quite a process and requires signing multi-year lease agreements, approved credit, security deposits, and more. This is a big step forward for any company, and we\u2019re happy to see a fellow LEB provider prosper and obtain their second office space.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dustin Cisneros, CEO of RackNerd states: </span><b>\u201cWe\u2019re stoked as a company! Achievements like this mean so much to us. As a result of our hard work, dedication towards our customers and brand, we\u2019re expanding. Happy to announce that we are moving our headquarter offices in under a year of obtaining our first office space. We\u2019re making big moves, and have plenty of other exciting news to share soon. Here we come Rancho Cucamonga, California!\u201d</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the post shared by RackNerd on their blog, the move-in date for their new headquarter offices in Rancho Cucamonga will be on August 1st, 2021.</span></p><p><b>A full copy of the post can be found below:</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the middle of a pandemic, we went out and opened new office space in Upland (Southern California) destined for RackNerd\u2019s Headquarters location, as we shared in previous blog posts.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the help of our valued customers, we\u2019ve grown and scaled RackNerd very quickly \u2013 from zero to a multi-million dollar revenue business, now currently serving customers out of 17 different datacenter locations globally. All of this would not have been possible without our customers, and we would like to thank you for being part of our journey and for making this possible.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are a customer service centric company, and we constantly make investments in our customers. This is made more and more evident by our continuous expansions, additional product features, and most importantly it is clear in the service we provide. Our reputation is excellent, our support is rapid, and our performance is second to none.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the first five months after moving into our existing office space, we experienced tremendous amount of growth from global customers as well as the local community, so much to the point that our CEO, Dustin B. Cisneros, had expressed interest in searching for a new office space. In Dustin\u2019s own words, he specifically said:</span></p><blockquote><p><b>\u201c</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, great office, especially as a starter office. We committed to it during the pandemic, as we have been thriving since our launch. It\u2019s a great way to be closely connected to local businesses, as well as hire local talent. We do plan on moving from here, to something bigger. Possibly like an industrial building, and doing something cool with one. We will see. We are signed here for now, for two years.\u201d</span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No doubt, an industrial building is totally cool, as it allows for office space to built to spec, for example in an industrial zone, you\u2019re able to build out spaces with private restroom, kitchen, sink area, etc. Not to mention, the ability to scale SQFT (essentially build whatever you can dream of).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, that intention has come true, fulfilling not only our dreams and desires, but this is a continuous illustration of our effort to continue on our mission of expanding. Despite signing a two year term, we\u2019re moving much sooner than that, just as we originally moved into our existing space much sooner than originally planned for.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that nothing in this universe stays the same \u2013 a condition can only improve or worsen. Here at RackNerd, we are constantly looking to improve, and by doing so \u2013 our customer\u2019s benefit. Despite a global pandemic, we went out and had our full attention on expansion \u2013 more product lines, more datacenter locations, obtaining real office space in Southern California, hiring more staff, introducing more features to existing customers, and so much more. We\u2019re grateful, and thankful to have you as a customer. We\u2019re sincerely excited for what the future brings.</span></p><h3><b>We\u2019re Moving!
