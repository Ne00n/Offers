There are&nbsp;<strong>many</strong>.</p><h2>Free Advertising!</h2><p>Your offer appears and will be seen by the readers here and there is zero cost to you.&nbsp; Sure, if you want it to be continually featured like those ads to the right of this post (thank you, advertisers!) we\u2019d love to sign you up on for ongoing advertising.&nbsp; But submitting offers on LEB costs you nothing.</p><h2>Targeted Advertising!</h2><p>If you\u2019re hunting moose, you don\u2019t go to Costa Rica.&nbsp; LowEndBox is a concentration of the kind of customers you want: daily users of shared, reseller, VPS, VPN, and dedicated hosting services.&nbsp; &nbsp;Our readers want to try new hosts.</p><h2>Backlinks!</h2><p>Every mention of you on LEB leverages LowEndBox\u2019s awesome page rank to boost your SEO and give your site link juice.&nbsp; We don\u2019t cripple links with \u201cnofollow\u201d or anything like that.&nbsp; Keywords like \u201chosting\u201d are some of the most expensive clicks you can buy on the big hosting platforms, so if you want to improve your organic traffic, post an offer and benefit from our juice.</p><h2>Loving Attention!</h2><p>LowEndBox is not just a laundry list of hosts.&nbsp; We check out each host before posting them, adorn their post with colorful art, trying to bring out the company\u2019s personality, and give you a great platform to tell your story.&nbsp; We\u2019re trying to create interesting content for our readers, so if you\u2019re looking for someone to spend a little time getting to know your company and share it with the world, post an offer on LEB.</p><h2>Stand Out From the Crowd!</h2><p>Let\u2019s face it: hosting is an intensely competitive market.&nbsp; If you\u2019re trying to compete purely on price, you\u2019ll be blown out of the water by big hosts with deep pockets and huge budgets.&nbsp; With LEB offers, you can distinguish yourself by making special, targeted offers.&nbsp; With coupon codes, you can track the response down to the subscriber.&nbsp; And by telling us what you want to post, you can position yourself in the broader market and find your niche.</p><p>Posting an offer on LowEndBox is one of the most cost-effective forms of marketing available to hosts today.&nbsp;
