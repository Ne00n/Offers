They are a VPS provider offering services out of LA and Ashburn, however they are based in the UK and offer UK support and have been featured on LEB and LET quite a few times. BudgetNode is run by Ishaq, and his business partner Jordan. Ishaq and Jordan are based in the UK, working different shifts, enabling them to offer round the clock support. BudgetNode started out in June 2016, out of Ashburn, Virginia. Last month, they expanded to Los Angeles, and have even greater plans to conquer other continents. So far, they only have OpenVZ, but more is planned.</p><p>Every week, we will be interviewing a different provider to find out a little more about them, and the business that they run.</p><p><span id=\"more-8924\"></span>So, lets get under way and straight into the interview:</p><p><strong>BudgetNode was only setup in June 2016. Can you tell us a little more about the beginnings of BudgetNode and what made you want to setup a VPS host?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We both have knowledge of this industry and it was being wasted by not applying it. We\u2019ve previously worked for many companies in this field and were at times unsatisfied with the way customers were being treated. Both of us were going to start up companies in the hosting industry with different offerings, but decided to join forces and work hard on building a good brand that we can improve and expand on as time goes. We want to provide an affordable hosting service with good support, not much different than others for now, but we have plans to offer something different and exciting in the future. We enjoy problem solving and we\u2019re passionate about what we do, so why not? :)</p></blockquote><p><strong>In the short time you have been running BudgetNode, what is the key thing that you think that running a VPS provider has taught you?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Customers can be so loyal. We don\u2019t offer our products as cheap as other hosts, so you would expect them to go running. But there are so many that would stay with us because they love our company. There are so many that show great appreciation for the service we provide \u2013 something we never&nbsp;expected.</p></blockquote><p><strong>You have 2 US locations, are there any plans to branch out into other continents like the EU?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Yes, definitely! We will move outside of the US. It could be the EU, it could be Asia. We have no plans set in stone yet \u2013 but we want to offer something unique. We said we would like to have a good balance of unique locations and popular locations. Ashburn was somewhere that had been tried in the past but hadn\u2019t grown that much. So we thought we would give it a try and it\u2019s worked well so far. LA is of course a popular choice amongst suppliers.</p></blockquote><p><strong>BudgetNode has been praised highly by the community. What tips would you provide to other hosts that maybe aren\u2019t as successful?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The approach we took is to make decisions in advance with a clear business plan rather than as we go along. That way you can be sure everyone is united in what you want to achieve. Furthermore, it is not worth sacrificing quality for a little saving in expenses each month. Clients that stick with you over a long period are far more valuable than those that come and go.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What can we expect to see from BudgetNode in the coming months?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We have many plans and ideas, and we want to execute them properly. OpenVZ certainly wont be our only product line. As previously said, we\u2019re trying to set ourself apart and offer something unique and exploring these options takes time. Stay tuned!</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to thank Ishaq and BudgetNode for taking the time to answer my questions, and I hope that you enjoyed reading too. If you are a provider, and want to feature on next weeks interview, just post a comment and I will select a provider.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fprovider-interview-budgetnode%2F&amp;t=Provider%20Interview%3A%20BudgetNode\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Provider%20Interview%3A%20BudgetNode&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fprovider-interview-budgetnode%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fprovider-interview-budgetnode%2F&amp;title=Provider%20Interview%3A%20BudgetNode&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
