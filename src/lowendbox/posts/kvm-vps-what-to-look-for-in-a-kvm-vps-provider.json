Cisneros from </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a seasoned and knowledgeable contributor of the hosting industry for 12+ years. Whether you are looking for shared hosting, reseller hosting, KVM VPS, dedicated servers, DRaaS, colocation, or managed services</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Say you\u2019re in need of a cheap KVM VPS hosting service \u2014 one question that comes into mind is, how do you find the right one for you? Is there any particular characteristic to look for in a </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/tag/kvm/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KVM VPS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provider?</span></p><p><span id=\"more-22468\"></span></p><p><b>Provider Track Record, Engagement &amp; Feedback</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s essential when looking for a KVM VPS provider that you look for one with a stable track record, this means searching LowEndBox and other hosting resource websites for the preferred provider of your choice. You can do so on LowEndBox by searching the provider name on the top right. </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/racknerd-new-exclusive-low-end-box-offers-1-5gb-kvm-vps-from-16-55-year-in-los-angeles/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an example of one of RackNerd\u2019s KVM VPS offering here on LowEndBox.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due diligence action items can include checking past LowEndBox comments, how engaged the provider is with users/feedback, etc. What feedback do you see? A provider lacking engagement publicly, especially for something targeted (i.e. marketing on LowEndBox, or other hosting resource related sites) probably won\u2019t be so active in their helpdesk either. You may not know it, but providers request to be \u201clisted\u201d or \u201cfeatured\u201d on LowEndBox and sites alike. So if they\u2019re requesting this and are not active, be cautious!</span></p><p><b>Redundancy / Server Hardware</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LowEndBox when featuring providers will list the hardware specs provided by the listed provider. This will help you in your search and helps provide a basic understanding of the infrastructure you will be deployed on.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for a provider who deploys KVM VPS based upon healthy host nodes, i.e dual CPU\u2019s, sufficient fast storage, RAM, and redundancy. Do they use RAID-10? This is crucial to ensuring stability in the event a drive fails. If the provider is running RAID-10 the good news is that the failing drive can be replaced without any data loss and most of the time without downtime!&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Network</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is the provider\u2019s network? Look for their test IPs/files within the LowEndBox listing for that provider and see if the latency and speeds work for your intended usage and audience. In addition, look for a provider who runs a multi-homed network. Hosting with a provider that operates a single-homed network can mean that if the ISP has an outage, your KVM VPS will experience network issues due to no redundancy from a transit standpoint. You will receive much more peace of mind by hosting with a provider that operates a multi-homed network, which means there are multiple ISP\u2019s in the network blend, eliminating any single point of ISP failure. Of course, when talking about network redundancy it is best to discuss this with your preferred provider, to learn how they\u2019ve designed their network. Do the network cabs have A+B power? Including the cabinet, your KVM VPS would be deployed in? Is there redundancy from the switch and router level? What is the provider\u2019s network uptime SLA? Of course, the goal is not to make your search anymore difficult, the goal is to ensure you\u2019re comfortable with your next KVM VPS purchase.</span></p><p><b>Support</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While things are running smoothly like they should be most of the time, you won\u2019t really have to interact with support. But it\u2019s important to know that support is and will be there whenever you need them, and as such, look on the provider\u2019s website to see if they provide 24/7 support, and if so via what channels. Is support available by support ticket, email, phone, live chat, or only one? The more communication channels a hosting provider has readily available is probably the more apt they will be to answer requests.</span></p><p><b>Social Media Engagement</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the hosting company active on social media \u2013 i.e. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram? Not every hosting provider is engaged with social media, so this should not necessarily be a solid requirement to look out for, but rather a tool you can check to get a better understanding and feel for how engaged the provider is with the public. Some providers will also use these channels to communicate with their end-users during outages, and or assist end-users who prefer social media for escalations.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feel free to test the provider\u2019s support, ticket in, inquire, don\u2019t be afraid to ask them how long they have been in the industry, in the business, and their long-term goals/vision? What makes them special, and unique? What locations do they have available? Some of these will help in your decision making! We hope your next KVM VPS purchase is from a </span><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LowEndBox</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provider!</span></p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fkvm-vps-what-to-look-for-in-a-kvm-vps-provider%2F&amp;t=KVM%20VPS%20%E2%80%93%20What%20To%20Look%20For%20in%20a%20KVM%20VPS%20Provider\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=KVM%20VPS%20%E2%80%93%20What%20To%20Look%20For%20in%20a%20KVM%20VPS%20Provider&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fkvm-vps-what-to-look-for-in-a-kvm-vps-provider%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fkvm-vps-what-to-look-for-in-a-kvm-vps-provider%2F&amp;title=KVM%20VPS%20%E2%80%93%20What%20To%20Look%20For%20in%20a%20KVM%20VPS%20Provider&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">3</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/fullvpsserver-returns-this-time-in-dallas-1gb-from-8-mo/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
