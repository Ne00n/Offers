Lots of stuff happening and as usual, the customer doesn\u2019t benefit.</p><h2>The GreenValueHost saga continues\u2026</h2><p>Just when you thought this couldn\u2019t get any bigger a mess than it already was, it did.</p><p>A while ago, Duke, from XFuse Solutions, acquired the GreenValueHost (let\u2019s call this GVH v1) clients and re-branded it into TacVPS. The full details of the deal were never disclosed to the public, but everybody\u2019s best guess is there was debt involved and that debt needed to be paid off. Either way, it seemed that customers were better off and Jonny Nguyen would quit the hosting industry. So far, so good.</p><p>Jonny, the original \u201cCEO\u201d or GHV v1, did a restart with GreenValueHost (let\u2019s call this GVH v2) and focused on Shared Hosting with 100% customer satisfaction at first. He later started offering Xen VPS as well. Needless to say, this was against every promise he made when he \u201csold\u201d GVH v1 to Duke and opened a new can of worms. A can of worms that could only end in\u2026</p><p><span id=\"more-7290\"></span></p><p>\u2026 yet another acquisition! Thomas Dale (former owner of UGVPS) and his company called \u2018Hostress\u2019 acquired GVH v2 offering them a better future and giving Jonny a (hopefully) final exit out of the hosting industry. The story doesn\u2019t end here, though, because only minutes/hours/days later, it turns out that Hostress had also acquired GVH v1 (now named TacVPS) from Duke. So, the situation right now should be as follows: all active GreenValueHost clients (regardless of which version or attempt) should now be at Hostress and Thomas is looking at fixing the entire operation. Hopefully that will finally get the customer some stable services.</p><p>Story to be continued in the future! I should have several machines at Hostress so I\u2019ll be sure you get back to you within one or two months to share how things are going.</p><h2>ChicagoVPS acquires BlueVM</h2><p>While this happened a while ago, and ChicagoVPS\u2019 Chris had already mentioned this on LowEndTalk once, the official announcement only came last week. ChicagoVPS has purchased BlueVM and is migrating all clients away from slabbed hardware onto better machines. Needless to say that during the past couple of months BlueVM was performing absolutely horrendously and their support was beyond bad. While I have some faith in it getting better, a recent support ticket didn\u2019t yet show much improvement though it\u2019s still being worked on. It seems like ChicagoVPS has a long way to go with fixing BlueVM and there\u2019s some serious obstacles down the road, mainly because of the state BlueVM was in. I count on the community to keep us informed; if you do, though, please share your ticket number or anything else that can help BlueVM identify you as a client in order to fix things. I\u2019ll keep you updated on this as well and will report back in the next Community Roundup!</p><h2>New hosts</h2><p>As usual, here\u2019s the new hosts we\u2019ve featured last month:</p><ul><li><a title=\"OnraHost \u2013 512MB Xen-HVM for $4/month and more in Los Angeles, CA, USA\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/onrahost-512mb-xen-hvm-for-4month-and-more-in-los-angeles-ca-usa/\">OnraHost</a></li><li><a title=\"Dediserve \u2013 $5.50/\u20ac5.00/\u00a33.75/month 1GB Xen in Sydney, AU and other locations\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/dediserve-5-50-e5-00-3-75-per-month-1gb-kvm-in-sydney-au-and-other-locations/\">Dediserve</a></li><li><a title=\"OnVirt \u2013 \u20ac6/month 1GB KVM 25GB SSD in Frankfurt, Germany\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/onvirt-e6-5month-1gb-kvm-25gb-ssd-in-frankfurt-germany/\">OnVirt</a></li><li><a title=\"GigsGigsCloud \u2013 $6/month OpenVZ VPS in Hong Kong and Malaysia\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/gigsgigscloud-6month-openvz-vps-in-hong-kong-and-malaysia/\">GigsGigsCloud</a></li><li><a title=\"HK@Server \u2013 $7/month VPS in Hong Kong and USA\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/hkserver-7month-vps-in-hong-kong-and-usa/\">HK@Server</a></li><li><a title=\"MyServerPlanet \u2013 VPS from \u00a32.50/yr and more in multiple locations\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/myserverplanet-vps-from-2-50yr-and-more-in-multiple-locations/\">MyServerPlanet </a></li></ul><p>Welcome to the club!</p><p></p><p>That\u2019s it again for this time.
