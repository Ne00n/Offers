So let\u2019s get started with the interview!</span></p><p><b>Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself, your background, and your role with <a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.racknerd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596997282528000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKrT_SsFmfzMQEqRUnSfykKaGv4Q\">RackNerd</a>?</b></p><p>A: Well my name is Dave Cooper and I\u2019m from Auckland, New Zealand. I started my IT career 15 years ago when I was 20 years of age. I\u2019m also a musician and a content creator. During those 15 years I ran my own company specializing in hosting, broadband and media solutions. This lead me to work for our national airline carrier Air New Zealand which I was responsible for rolling out technical IT projects across the world.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My role at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.racknerd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596997282528000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKrT_SsFmfzMQEqRUnSfykKaGv4Q\">RackNerd</a>&nbsp;is to maintain a brand that is friendly, informative and open by creating video content, graphics and blogs.</p><p><span id=\"more-24384\"></span></p><p><b>Q: What do you enjoy most about creating digital content? What do you find most difficult?</b></p><p>A: The beautiful thing about creating content and what excites me is that you get to set a mood for the viewers. Whether you\u2019re watching a video or browsing a website, all the content you see in front of you is created to set a mood, that\u2019s what marketing is all about.&nbsp; I would say the most difficult thing would be the process, I\u2019m a perfectionist when it comes to creating, so sometimes that slows the process down a bit.</p><p><strong>Q: <b>What are some of the best digital marketing related advice you can give to those looking to grow their business?</b></strong></p><p>A: Don\u2019t throw tons of information at your clients, be bold and informative, but not annoying.&nbsp; The key to a successful marketing campaign is create a mood that your customers can engage with. Always put yourself in your customers shoes, and create marketing campaigns that are easy to understand and that you wouldn\u2019t mind seeing.</p><p><strong>Q: <b>Where do you think the future takes the hosting industry in general?</b></strong></p><p>A: Personally, the hosting industry will keep growing as it is, VR is going to have an impact in a huge way, we will get smarter and innovate some cool things but I do think we need to have security on our mind at all times.&nbsp; It\u2019s inevitable data needs to be online but how we manage that data from prying eyes is still holding a lot of people back and it\u2019s our job to help protect that privacy.</p><p><strong>Q: <b>Both personally and professionally, what guiding principles ground you?</b></strong></p><p>A: Love this question, remembering where I came from, I did not have a privileged life growing up nor did I have a bad one. Though I worked hard to learn and motivate myself to be where I am today, though it was not easy I\u2019m very grateful to the people that have helped me along the way.&nbsp; I hope to do the same.</p><p><strong>Q: <b>Tell us more about some exciting developments you are currently working on with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.racknerd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596997282528000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKrT_SsFmfzMQEqRUnSfykKaGv4Q\">RackNerd</a>?</b></strong></p><p>A: O MUCH!&nbsp; We have some more blogs coming up, tutorial videos, and we\u2019re already working on our Black Friday Sale, so lots of exciting things to come.</p><p><strong>Q: <b>Final thoughts and anything you would like to add?</b></strong></p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covid-19 has really screwed up a lot of businesses and it\u2019s heart breaking\u2026All I can say is stick with it don\u2019t give up this is a moment in time and we will get through it!&nbsp; Take this time to invest and think on the positives and not pull back.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also want to thank LowendBox for this opportunity.
