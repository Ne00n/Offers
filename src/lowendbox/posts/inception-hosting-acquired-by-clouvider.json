Inception Hosting will continue to operate as a separate company. You will see no changes, the invoices, payments and your contract(s) remain with Inception Hosting Limited.</p><p><em>The history of Inception Hosting</em><br>\nInception Hosting started from humble beginnings back in 2011 in part because I Anthony Smith, previous owner and director of Inception Hosting was as a service user frustrated with a lack of quality of service and care in the budget side of the market. Having spent a lot of years running enterprise-grade technical service desks and doing so to a high standard I knew it would not take much to provide a great alternative to many of the other hosts out there with a \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d frame of mind when it came to support and quality because usually, you did not even get that.</p><p>It brought me great pleasure to generate a reputation as a stable, competent affordable yet quality hosting option in the budget end of the market often getting favourably compared to significantly more expensive option. However, in truth it has taken years and years of 12+ hour days, 7 days a week rarely with a day off for the last 10 years to get it to the stage it is at now.</p><p><em>What does the future hold?</em><br>\nWith trends changing and significant development needed to innovate and advance the future offers available to customers; new and old, that meant some investment was needed in order to take things to the next level rather than tread water for years to come.</p><p>Because Clouvider is already the trusted backend to over 70% of Inception Hosting\u2019s servers and often publicly acknowledged as a very high-quality network and server provider themselves with their demand for high standards and quality above all else it just made sense from my perspective for Inception Hosting to be absorbed by Clouvider in order to give it and Inception Hosting customers the best possible chance of being where it needs to be within the market over the next 10 years and it will be exciting to make available services from Inception Hosting in other Clouvider locations.</p><p>Many customers have now trusted Inception Hosting for a full 10 years and I am very excited for the future, I really believe this was the best move to position Inception Hosting where it needs to be to take the service and quality to the next level. To be clear Inception Hosting did not need to be sold, nothing was ever at risk this was a mutual meeting of minds, discussions took place over the best part of a year and both sides felt comfortable about the idea right away.</p><p><em>Is Anthony staying onboard?</em><br>\nYes! I will remain active, employed now directly by Clouvider and part of my primary responsibilities will be to continue to look after Inception Hosting so not a huge amount will change for customers in the short/medium term although some new names may pop up on the support desk.</p><p><em>I have a question\u2026</em><br>\nIf you have any questions or queries about this acquisition then please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.</p><p>Kind Regards,<br>\nAnthony Smith,<br>\nTeam Inception Hosting</p><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/merry-christmas-from-proximcloud-shared-hosting-in-london-from-1-10-mo/\"><div style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Merry Christmas from ProximCloud!
