Throughout the years as the hosting industry evolved, we have adapted and made changes along the way in order to successfully continue to meet your modern-day hosting needs, however, our mission, goal, and passion has always remained the same since day one: to help others achieve affordable hosting, and to be a one-stop resource for all your hosting needs.</p><p>Today, LowEndBox is not only a helpful resource for those seeking a VPS solution, but also shared/reseller hosting, dedicated servers, hybrid servers, VPN\u2019s, and so much more!</p></div><div><p>With the holiday season upon us, we would like to take the time to reflect and thank you for being there with us and for joining the LEB movement. Our movement is to make noise in the hosting industry, and to disrupt the overpriced hosting market. It is to set a standard for affordable and transparent hosting in the marketplace. We\u2019ve been successful with advancing this movement for over 10 years and counting, and we are happy for the positive contributions we have made to people\u2019s online goals throughout the years. None of this would not be possible without your contributions to the community \u2013 so thank you LowEndBox reader!</p><p><b>HEADS UP:</b>&nbsp;We will be launching a stream of VERY AGGRESSIVE offers throughout the holiday season from various of your favorite providers!
