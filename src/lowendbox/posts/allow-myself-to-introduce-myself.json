As you may have noticed I\u2019ve taken over some of the posting responsibilities here at LowEndBox and I figured it was about time that I introduce myself. I\u2019m Matt, the marketing guy over at ColoCrossing.<span id=\"more-10740\"></span></p><p>I really wanted to address a few things now that I\u2019ve gotten my feet wet. The first thing is that you may have noticed the frequency of posts has gone down a bit over the last few months. When I got into the tickets, there were so many that were months old. This was happening for a myriad of reasons, but most of all was just lack of time to keep up on them. This isn\u2019t going to happen going forward. I did, however, decide to clear out the bulk of the old offers.</p><p>If you\u2019re a vendor who has recently submitted and we didn\u2019t post or respond, please know that this wasn\u2019t personal.&nbsp;If you feel like you have a compelling offer, please resubmit. Solid vendors are very important to me, but as a vendor, you have to understand that my&nbsp;first responsibility is to provide our readers with offers that they\u2019re interested in. If you\u2019re unsure if your deal is attractive enough for us to post, do a little research. Go back into some older posts and see what deals were met with excitement from the readers: they\u2019re the ones that are going to make or break your sale.</p><p>As for our readership: I want to take a moment to thank you all for continuing to be a part of this community. Without you guys we wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to run this board. What I\u2019d like to do is open up a discussion to find out if there is anything you think we could do better. Keep in mind &nbsp;that, yes, ChicagoVPS and Hudson Valley Host will still get posted&nbsp;\u2013 please remember that this isn\u2019t a charity, it is a business. We do our best to keep a solid mix of offers from a ton of different providers out there, but we have to make sure it makes sense for us to put in the time and effort. That being said, are there any types of plans/deals that you\u2019d like to see? I have no problem seeking out some vendors and leveraging our volume of traffic to try and get better deals for you all. There is a certain amount of buying power that you have simply because you\u2019re a part of this community and it should make sense for vendors to want to offer special promos based on that buying power.</p><p>Also, a lot of folks have submitted tickets regarding the broken RSS feed \u2013 and that should now be working again, apologies for how long that took us to fix that. If you\u2019re still having trouble, please do not hesitate to let us know.</p><p>Last thing: if you don\u2019t already, please follow us on twitter @lowendnetwork as we\u2019ve recently started to actually use that. We\u2019ll be publishing special offers there as well.</p><p>So what can we do better? This is going to be a lot, isn\u2019t it? :-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fallow-myself-to-introduce-myself%2F&amp;t=Allow%20myself%20to%20introduce...myself\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Allow%20myself%20to%20introduce...myself&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fallow-myself-to-introduce-myself%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fallow-myself-to-introduce-myself%2F&amp;title=Allow%20myself%20to%20introduce...myself&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/mzelasko/\" title=\"All posts by Matt Zelasko\" rel=\"author\">Matt Zelasko</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f95732fa24234bcd42da5868fe5bfeef?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\"></p></div></div><div class=\"feedback\"></div></div>"}
