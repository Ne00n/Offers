But <b>why</b>? Why would I want to host my websites on a 64MB $5/month VPS? Here are some reasons:</p><ol><li><b>Because you are cheap</b>. You are a starving student who does not have $50/month renting a managed VPS to host your forums. Or maybe you do, but you have <em>accidentally</em> spent $45 more than you should in the pub. After all we all want the best bang for the bucks, don\u2019t we?</li><li><b>Because you are frugal</b>. You get annoyed when people mentioned the word \u201ccPanel\u201d or \u201cApache\u201d or \u201cJava\u201d or anything that occupies tons of memory doing nothing, and you enjoy squeezing the last bit of juice from something small and nice. Why waste all these resources \u2014 memory, disk space and electricity \u2014 when you can achieve the same with a smaller box?</li><li><b>Because you are bored</b>. Is there anything that\u2019s more fun than trying to run your entire Django stack, all the way from Apache mod_python to MySQL database, on a 64MB VPS? Yes sure! Trying to get a RoR stack to run on the VPS of same spec.</li><li><b>Because you want to learn</b>. Sometimes we can get lazy and rely on GUI and web-based control panels\u2026 How dare you?! The best way to learn Linux, xBSD and other operating systems is by dipping into the core. The best control panel? Don\u2019t tell me SSH + Vim is not enough (yes you don\u2019t even need Emacs). A small box will force you to work hard and learn hard.</li><li><b>Because you want to brag</b>. Just wander into any discussion thread on <a href=\"http://www.webhostingtalk.com/\">WebHostingTalk</a> where someone asks \u201cDo I need 512MB to run my WordPress blogs properly?\u201d Tell them 64MB is more than enough.</li></ol><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2F5-reasons-why-you-want-a-low-end-box%2F&amp;t=5%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Want%20a%20Low%20End%20Box\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=5%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Want%20a%20Low%20End%20Box&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2F5-reasons-why-you-want-a-low-end-box%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2F5-reasons-why-you-want-a-low-end-box%2F&amp;title=5%20Reasons%20Why%20You%20Want%20a%20Low%20End%20Box&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">5</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/admin/\" title=\"All posts by LowEndAdmin\" rel=\"author\">LowEndAdmin</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo litespeed-loaded\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11a4d9191634a9374eeca7d0e8982ba2?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></div><p class=\"bio-description\">The original owner of LowEndBox known as \"LowEndAdmin\" or \"LEA\" for short founded LowEndBox in 2008 and created the concept of hosting applications on low resource \"Low End Boxes\".
