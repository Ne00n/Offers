Crypto currency fulfills that void. Here at Nexus Bytes, we accept major crypto currency such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherium and Bitcoin Cash.</p><p>Crypto currency is yet to become a stable flat currency, that we could rely on to perform day to day transactions. To most, this is still an asset rather than currency, with real world value. Which also creates a volatile market, where the currency loses stability.</p><p>Here at Nexus Bytes, we usually (and almost always instantly) convert and withdraw expense portion of the currency to USD. We convert the rest to BTC and keep the remainder (profit) as future investment and let it ride the wave.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2099/02/racknerd_150.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26500 alignleft litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2099/02/racknerd_150.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"20\" data-was-processed=\"true\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dustin Cisneros, CEO of <a href=\"https://my.racknerd.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RackNerd</a></strong></p><p>RackNerd who was voted #1 as LowEndTalk\u2019s top provider accepts cryptocurrency payments via Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, and ZCash.</p><p>It goes without saying that cryptocurrency\u2019s value is constantly variable and dynamic, and while at some times, what an end-user pays you via cryptocurrency today may go up in value tomorrow, as a company you should also be prepared if it were to go the other direction. A handful of transaction\u2019s potential variable amount should not impact your health as a company \u2013 and I think that also improves with scale as you continue to grow as a company.</p><p>The number one reason why businesses fail today is because their ideas/products weren\u2019t sold quickly enough, AND in quantities high enough. You need to have both margin and volume in order to run a sustainable business that can weather any economic impact. In my last guest post <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/guest-post-how-to-succeed-and-expand-as-a-business-in-2021-by-dustin-cisneros-ceo-of-racknerd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, I went over 5 tips on how to succeed and expand as a business in 2021, and how you can continue to expand your business even during COVID-19 times. In conclusion, you can monitor your cryptocurrency transactions to see the value change on a day-by-day basis and take actions based on what you as a company are comfortable with, or alternatively \u2013 some payment processors may offer the ability to immediately convert the cryptocurrency payment from the end-user to USD for you.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxNTAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTUwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTUwIDE1MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26501 alignleft\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2099/02/servermania.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"20\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Justin Blanchard, CMO of <a href=\"https://www.servermania.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ServerMania</a></strong></p><p>ServerMania accepts Bitcoin as the only form of cryptocurrency, however, customers must speak to a sales agent when placing the order to receive instructions on how to complete the payment. This is an easy process that can be completed through live chat, ticket or over the phone at the time of checkout.</p><p>Bitcoin\u2019s current exchange rate will be charged at the time of submitting the order. For example, if the request is being made on a Saturday the order may not be processed until Monday (during sales hours), so charges would reflect Monday\u2019s Bitcoin exchange rate.</p><p>We will be placing more of a priority on building a module for Bitcoin on our order form once we see the increase in demand from Bitcoin paying customers.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxNTAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTUwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTUwIDE1MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26502 alignleft\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2099/02/onapp_150.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"20\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ditlev Bredahl, CEO, <a href=\"https://www.onapp.com\">OnApp</a></strong></p><p>As you probably know, we don\u2019t sell cloud hosting, instead we enable hosts to sell cloud \u2013 and looking at our data since 2010, some of our customers do offer crypto as an option alongside traditional currencies, but mainstream currencies are still most popular. But, that stuff isn\u2019t important.</p><p>What\u2019s important about crypto is that it\u2019s an enabler for hosts. It\u2019s a way to escape the clutches of VISA, Mastercard, Paypal. I bet most people reading this have been kicked from their payment provider at some point, or they\u2019ve had funds frozen. That\u2019s because of chargebacks from \u201cestablishment\u201d payment systems, or KYC, or because of content restrictions etc. But if you think about \u201chow to implement payment\u201d in the first place, the point is: not everyone finds it easy to get a bank account, let alone a payment provider.</p><p>I\u2019m not trying to pick on specific countries, but what if you\u2019re an entrepreneur in Indonesia, for example? You have a great idea, you have a USP, you have your infra and your service\u2026 but you\u2019re forced to go with a payment solution that\u2019s charging you 3-5%, your 2checkout for example. You\u2019re a start-up, it isn\u2019t sustainable. With BTC it can either be fully P2P, or a middle-man situation with a commission that\u2019s more like 0.1%.</p><p>If hosts start accepting BTC, then BTC starts becoming part of the ecosystem. And in terms of fluctuation, you have options there too: stablecoin, for example. Crypto isn\u2019t mainstream yet \u2013 it will be a while before your average head of accounts or CFO is looking to pay their invoices with cryptocurrency \u2013 but it will happen.
