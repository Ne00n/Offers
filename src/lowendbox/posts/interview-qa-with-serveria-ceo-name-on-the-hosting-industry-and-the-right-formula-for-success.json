So, let\u2019s get started with the interview!</span></p><p><strong>Tell me about your background and your company\u2019s history?</strong></p><p><em>Serveria was founded back in 2009 by a group of privacy-conscious IT professionals in Riga, Latvia. The project started out as a single self-hosted shared server. From the very beginning, we paid great attention to things like security and anonymity of our clients. We are a niche host and we realize we\u2019ll never become super huge like the big guys Hetzner etc\u2026 nevertheless, we had a terrific decade and the growth was exponential. From a single shared server to our own privately owned data center.</em></p><p><span id=\"more-22869\"></span></p><p><strong>What would you tell someone looking to start a hosting company today? What advice would you offer?</strong></p><p><em>Don\u2019t listen to anyone, you can do it! Back in 2009 people were saying you shouldn\u2019t mess with the big guys like Hostgator. You have no chance, there are thousands of hosting companies around! Give up! Let go! All it takes is a courage to start, to take the risk, to face the challenge. You and your ideas are unique, you will succeed.</em></p><p><strong>Where do you think the future takes the hosting industry?</strong></p><p><em>More and more mainstream services are going to move to the cloud but niche hosts will still be around offering bare metal servers for specific needs. Stricter anti-privacy laws are coming so people will start to value privacy more.</em></p><p><strong>What makes your company unique in today\u2019s evolving market landscape? How are you evolving with the times?</strong></p><p>In fact, lots of things make us unique starting with our geographical location and our views on privacy and security. At the same time, I guess we\u2019re quite similar to most other providers the way our infrastructure evolves. We\u2019re migrating to SSD on a large scale, introducing green energy, IPv6 addressing etc. These processes started a long time ago but still go on as they appeared to be more complex, slow and expensive than everyone in the industry thought initially.</p><p><strong>What do you enjoy most about your role? What do you find most difficult?</strong></p><p>Both the most enjoyed and challenging aspect is communication with customers. Technical and administration seems easy if you have qualified staff, whereas clients can\u2019t be predicted, controlled in any way. Which is great, because every day brings new challenges, new exciting projects.</p><p><strong>Both personally and professionally, what guiding principles ground you?</strong></p><p>Customer is a king \u2013 everything should be done to please a client and make him happy. Customer satisfaction is our number 1 priority. Anonymity is not a crime. It\u2019s a basic right to remain private online. Under no circumstances we\u2019re going to give customer info/data out to 3rd parties (except a court order from a local court). Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll tolerate any criminal activities.</p><p><strong>Give us some details on new and exciting things you are working on?</strong></p><p><em>If we speak about our latest projects, I can mention that we are developing our own encrypted email service at the moment. Right now we\u2019re still in the testing stage but I can tell you we have some cards up our sleeve to make sure this thing won\u2019t become just another Protonmail clone.</em></p><p><strong>Why should customers trust you and your business?</strong></p><p>We are a company with 11 years of experience in the hosting industry. The company never changed owners, most of the employees we hired 10 years ago are also still with us. We also managed to retain many customers who signed up in 2009 and their servers are still up and running, even without hardware upgrades.</p><p><strong>Final thoughts and anything you would like to add?</strong></p><p><em>Thanks for this awesome opportunity to let the community learn more about our company! I hope this short interview gives a hint on what our company is about.</em></p><p>Check out Serveria by clicking their banner below!</p><p><a href=\"https://serveria.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDkiIGhlaWdodD0iMzE1IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTA5IDMxNSI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22874 size-full\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23095-serveria.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"315\" data-srcset=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23095-serveria.png.webp 509w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/23095-serveria-300x186.png.webp 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\"></a></p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-serveria-ceo-name-on-the-hosting-industry-and-the-right-formula-for-success%2F&amp;t=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Serveria%20CEO%20Paul%20Estrada%20on%20the%20Hosting%20Industry%2C%20and%20the%20Right%20Formula%20for%20Success\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Serveria%20CEO%20Paul%20Estrada%20on%20the%20Hosting%20Industry%2C%20and%20the%20Right%20Formula%20for%20Success&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-serveria-ceo-name-on-the-hosting-industry-and-the-right-formula-for-success%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-serveria-ceo-name-on-the-hosting-industry-and-the-right-formula-for-success%2F&amp;title=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Serveria%20CEO%20Paul%20Estrada%20on%20the%20Hosting%20Industry%2C%20and%20the%20Right%20Formula%20for%20Success&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
