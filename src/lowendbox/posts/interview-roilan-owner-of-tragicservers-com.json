TragicServers first appeared on LowEndBox in 2014, with their last appearance&nbsp;all the way back in January of 2015. TragicServers provides a variety of services, including popular game server hosting, Mumble hosting, and of course&nbsp;their OpenVZ line in Dallas and Los Angeles. They recently also announced their new KVM line located in Los Angeles.</p><p><span id=\"more-9047\"></span></p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 Hi Roilan. I want to start off with a basic question. What were the beginnings of TragicServers? A question you get a lot, \u201cWhy TragicServers?\u201d. Where did the name come from? Is there a story?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 First of all, thanks for asking to interview me. It\u2019s a pleasure and extremely excited to do this. I started back in May of 2012 strictly with Team Fortress 2 servers. A few months before starting all I wanted to do was play on my own TF2 server with friends for free. Free meaning that I didn\u2019t want to pay out of pocket and the cost had to be covered somehow. Shortly after discovering LEB, I settled for a $7 VPS from one of the providers here. Even though I was able to cover cost, it had terrible performance and people weren\u2019t happy.</p><p>Within a few weeks after the initial \u201claunch\u201d, ideas started flowing. I noticed a big problem in the competitive TF2 community. Nobody understood how to configure their server for competitive play. Not only that but no providers cared. It bothered me because they matter. I had an idea of focusing on them and strictly them by providing them ready to go servers. That meant no needing to upload configs, maps, etc. It was just ready for you to play. I remember telling this idea to someone and they called it stupid. Well, within a few months, it grew and blew up pretty fast. Needless to say, they were wrong :)</p><p>I wish I had a cool or epic story why but it\u2019s pretty simple. My gaming alias is \u201ctragic\u201d and my focus was on providing servers. So, I just put the two together. Some people question it but the only thing \u201ctragic\u201d about us is our name, haha.</p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 Let\u2019s talk about growth. Expanding TragicServers into what it is today. What are some things you\u2019ve learned, not just as a business man but also as a person?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 This is a great question. I would say the #1 thing I\u2019ve learned is to focus and do what I love. You can\u2019t start any type of business with the mindset of \u201cscrew that customer\u201d. You\u2019ll lose fast. To many people are focused on money instead providing value.</p><p>Your word matters. If I make a promise to a customer, or anyone for that matter, I need to stick to it. There have been a couple of times where I have made a mistake, in terms of pricing or allocating resources to a customer. They already paid and received their service. I have to stick to my word on those mistakes because the customer matters more than the mistake I made.</p><p>Patience. I am incredibly patient with any type of move I make. We have been around since 2012 and in the LE* world since 2014-2015 or so. It wasn\u2019t until a few months ago that people really started to notice us here. Most people would have panicked and quit.</p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 You have a large focus on game servers. Does this stem from your own hobbies or was it purely a business decision?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 I love games. Always have and always will. It was never a business decision to open a game server company, it just happened because of my love for games.</p><p>However, it was a business decision to keep going forward and provide people with awesome service. Believe it or not, we\u2019re not in the game and VPS business. We\u2019re in the customer service business. If people are happy, we\u2019re happy. It shows we\u2019re going a good job with post like this: <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/88700/tragicservers-a-good-example-of-how-to-stand-out-from-other-providers\">https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/88700/tragicservers-a-good-example-of-how-to-stand-out-from-other-providers</a></p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 Last question about your game services. Being a smaller company in terms of staff, you have the opportunity to be more personal to those you advertise&nbsp;to. In fact, most of our communication about this interview was done over Steam. What are some of the ways you take advantage of that opportunity?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 Funny that you ask this question since it brought back some awesome memories. When we first started, I was really big and into providing personalized and on-demand customer service. For all our game servers, we required you included your Steam profile and I added every single person. I wanted to get to know every single customer that trusted us to place an order. Not only that, but I played games and built relationships with them.</p><p>I still have a lot of my first customers on Steam today. Sadly, we have grown much larger than Steam allows you to have on friends. I wish I could add everyone though. If anyone wants to add me and play some games together, link below.</p><p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tragic886\">http://steamcommunity.com/id/tragic886</a></p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 Tell us about your new KVM line. Any potential exclusive discount?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 Definitely. A month or so ago, we sent our customers a survey with various questions on what we could do better. I\u2019d say the #1 request was KVM. They wanted KVM and they wanted it now. We also saw a large number of request in our OVZ offers for KVM. We\u2019re in the customer service business after all, so we\u2019re providing KVM for them and extremely focused on it. If anyone wants to try us out, I\u2019ve added some exclusive plans below:</p><p>256MB RAM<br>\n1 CPU Core<br>\n10GB HD space<br>\n500GB Bandwidth<br>\n1 Gbps Port<br>\n1 IPv4<br>\n3 IPv6<br>\nTUN/TAP<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.tragicservers.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=158\">https://www.tragicservers.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=158</a></p><p>1024MB RAM<br>\n2 CPU Core<br>\n20GB HD space<br>\n1000GB Bandwidth<br>\n1 Gbps Port<br>\n1 IPv4<br>\n3 IPv6<br>\nTUN/TAP<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.tragicservers.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=159\">https://www.tragicservers.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=159</a></p><p>2048MB RAM<br>\n2 CPU Core<br>\n30GB HD space<br>\n2000GB Bandwidth<br>\n1 Gbps Port<br>\n1 IPv4<br>\n3 IPv6<br>\nTUN/TAP<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.tragicservers.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=160\">https://www.tragicservers.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=160</a></p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 If a younger you, or someone new to this whole industry wanted some advice on how to get started, what would you tell them?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 Learn from the people who came before you. I observe and read an incredible amount. We live in age where people are posting freely what they do, did and how they failed. Learn from that. If you go through LE*, you\u2019ll see the mistakes others have made and what not to do. You\u2019ll also see the success. I learned a ton from that. Learn from the awesome providers around you. Just because they might be in the same market as you doesn\u2019t mean you have to be rude, mean, etc to each other. Competition is great and you have to love it.</p><p>Personally, it\u2019s always a pleasure reading what Francisco has to say. I also pickup some services from him and NickA. Some might say, \u201cbut aren\u2019t they your competitors\u201d? Nope. If you observe and read what each one says or does, it\u2019s different. No two or three providers are the same or the people behind them. I would say it would be disservice to yourself by not learning from them and many others.</p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 What does the future look like for TragicServers? Any potential locations, or new services in mind?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 We still love and will continue supporting the TF2 community, our servers and services like Serveme, PugChamp, NewbieMixes and much more. Along with all the other wonderful services that connect players together for free. It\u2019s what I wanted before TragicServers and glad I can provide it for others.</p><p>For VPS, we\u2019re definitely looking at Chicago for our next OVZ or KVM location. I have a feeling we\u2019re going to launch with KVM first. Aside from that, we\u2019re going to be focusing on features and our brand. WHMCS and SolusVM is very limiting for us. There is a lot more I want to do with our site and control panel(s). A lot of other providers are waiting for someone to code the next solution for both platforms. We\u2019re not, we\u2019re going to build it for our customers in-house and from scratch. We don\u2019t really have a timeline for this but we\u2019re working on it. We might open source some things from this, so that\u2019s going to be awesome.</p><p><strong>Q&nbsp;\u2013 Any closing statements?</strong></p><p>A \u2013 Just wanted to say thanks again for the interview. It\u2019s been awesome being able to share my thoughts and express how much we care about you. If anyone has any questions, feel free to reach me personally via Steam, Skype or Email<strong>*</strong>. I would say support ticket but I want to speak to you personally :)</p><p><strong>*To prevent spam, contact information has been redacted. &nbsp;Please use the contact on the TragicServers website to get in touch with Roilan.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Thank you to @Daily&nbsp;and Roilan for taking part in this interview contribution. &nbsp;If you would like to contribute content to LowEndBox, please contact @SysAdmin on <a href=\"http://www.lowendtalk.com\">LowEndTalk.com</a></p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-roilan-owner-of-tragicservers-com%2F&amp;t=Interview%20-%20Roilan%2C%20owner%20of%20TragicServers.com\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interview%20-%20Roilan%2C%20owner%20of%20TragicServers.com&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-roilan-owner-of-tragicservers-com%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-roilan-owner-of-tragicservers-com%2F&amp;title=Interview%20-%20Roilan%2C%20owner%20of%20TragicServers.com&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">0</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
