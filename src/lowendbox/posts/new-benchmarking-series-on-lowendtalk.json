They\u2019re detailed, factual, and well-written and if you\u2019re interested in benchmarks of popular providers, well worth your time to read.</p><h2>What is Benchmarking?</h2><p>Benchmarking consists of running various tests and comparing performance between providers. It could be done on VPSes or dedicated servers. While it could be done manually, typically scripts and tools are used. Areas such as CPU performance, disk performance, and network performance are sampled and compared.</p><p>There are many test suites available and they operate at all levels of the stack. One popular benchmark is bench.sh, which is both the name of the script and its URL. You can download that script and run it. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://github.com/sayem314/serverreview-benchmark/blob/master/bench.sh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another</a> I used to see frequently used.</p><p><span id=\"more-24802\"></span></p><p>There are other types of tests \u2013 for example, different tools that generate load on web servers. The goal is to generate a set of data and then compare results between providers in order to select the optimally-performing system for your needs.</p><p>That \u201cfor your needs\u201d is key. If you\u2019re running a VPN proxy to Tokyo, than Asian network connectivity is going to matter far more than I/O. For a game server, ping times to where you play is more important than network speed tests pulling from the other side of the world. And if you\u2019re running a database server, then CPU and disk performance may outweigh a better ping time.</p><h2>Limitations of Benchmarking</h2><p>Benchmarking is not perfect, and you cannot simply run a script and programatically determine the optimal node for your needs. Some limitations of benchmarking include:</p><ul><li>You may have other processes running on the nodes which consume CPU, disk, etc. that could skew benchmarking results.</li><li>As customers are loaded onto host nodes, performance may change.</li><li>Network performance can vary based on what neighbor VPSes are doing, network issues, intermediate hops, etc.</li><li>Benchmarking can\u2019t test things like provider reliability, downtimes, etc. A host that performs extremely well but is frequently down probably doesn\u2019t fit your needs as well as one that is perhaps a few percentage points slower but has high uptime.</li><li>And of course, benchmarks don\u2019t provide just one number, so you need to weigh what\u2019s important to you.</li></ul><p>Benchmarking is simply one more tool you can use to evaluate hosts, not a definitive, binary answer.</p><h2>A New Benchmark</h2><p><strong>jsg</strong> has been working on a new tool called vpsb which performs a great deal of analysis on nodes. It was born of his view of shortcomings in traditional benchmarks. To quote from its manual:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cvpsb\u201d (VPS benchmark) is a tool to get meaningful and relevant info about a SUT (\u201cserver under test\u201d). This information consists of</p><p>\u2013 system information. Things like cpu type, number of cores, memory but also<br>\nsome less basic info like cache level sizes and flags.</p><p>\u2013 performance. This is about processor and memory performance. While this might sound like not much (there\u2019s a ton of benchmarks out there) a typical internet server isn\u2019t much about integer and/or floating point performance but mainly about moving and processing large amounts of data, lots of strings and increasingly about crypto jobs.</p><p>In other words; many if not most benchmarks aren\u2019t exactly helpful and useful when benchmarking, say a web server. vpsb, however, is made expressly for those jobs and the performance benchmarks make sure to trash caches, to test typical crypto operations and to move around large amounts of data. Also the performance test is done both single and multi core.</p><p>\u2013 disks. vpsb tests disks, in addition to sequential tests, in a way that trashes buffers in random access based tests (unlike sequential ones) which are truly and seriously random. Both the sectors (the location accessed) and the data itself are purely random (using a good quality PRNG)</p><p>\u2013 networking. This is an obvious one. After all the network is to a server what the pond is to a fish. vpsb approaches that task in a way that is rather different from most other tools. For a start \u2013 and unlike most server benchmarks \u2013 vpsb gives you true and relevant numbers. Unlike other tests vpsb starts measuring only after name resolution and http setup of the other side, i.e. vpsb measures what you are really interested in.&nbsp; In addition vpsb v.2.x provides both normal and web ping times.</p></blockquote><p>You can read more about it in <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/166553/leb-let-benchmarks-vps-benchmark-2-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this LowEndTalk thread</a>.
