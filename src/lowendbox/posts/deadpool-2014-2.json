Ironically enough, one of the deadpooled providers was one that called another deadpooled provider a SCAM\u2026 Let\u2019s get cracking!</p><hr><p><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Managed-VPS-Dedicated-Hosting-Dedicated-Minds-2013-12-03-21-10-28-300x193.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"screenshot litespeed-loaded\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Managed-VPS-Dedicated-Hosting-Dedicated-Minds-2013-12-03-21-10-28-300x193.png.webp\" alt=\"Dedicated Minds\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\" data-was-processed=\"true\"><strong>Dedicated Minds<br>\n</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Status:</span> Server not found/website offline/nodes offline</p><p>The minds of Dedicated Minds were not as dedicated as we anticipated when they launched. Reece Chroftes registered Dedicated Minds as a company in May 2013 together with Tyler Curtis, but Reece left as a director shortly after. The company is still active but the website is nowhere to be found. We did feature Dedicated Minds once on LowEndBox and the response were mixed judging by the comments to that post. After a period of slow responses and downtime they seem to have vanished not to be found again.</p><p><span id=\"more-5801\"></span></p><hr><p><strong>KVMVPS.us<br>\n</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Status:</span> Server not found/website offline/nodes offline</p><p>KVMVPS.us was run by the eccentric Ryyan Hasan (\u201cSunn\u201d), who has meanwhile been banned from LowEndTalk for acting racist against another LowEndTalk member. We have never actually featured then on LowEndBox, but they were quite active on LowEndTalk offering KVM-based VPS with a 100% uptime guarantee from New York City. It was a bumpy ride either way and it ended before it caused too much drama.</p><hr><p><strong>IntroNetServers</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Status:</span> Server not found/website offline/nodes offline</p><p>Criticized by KVMVPS.us owner Ryyan Hasan, IntroNetServers deadpooled somewhere in May. They offered cheap VPS from SingleHop\u2019s Amsterdam location and have made several offers on LowEndTalk. This is another host that has never been featured on LowEndBox. They offered VPS starting at $2 including a cPanel license, a free SSL certificate, and a free domain name. Needless to say, this is the least unexpected deadpool in history.</p><hr><p>This concludes this deadpool post.
