An investigation determined that the capsules had been laced with cyanide by parties unknown.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, the makers of Tylenol, responded by immediately removing all Tylenol products (even those not involved) from shelves across America, at a cost of $265 million in 2020 dollars. They offered to replace at no cost any products consumers had already purchased. They did not restock stores until they could repackage with new, tamper-evident seals and safeguards.</p><p>In the aftermath of the crisis, the Tylenol brand\u2019s market share plummeted from 35% to 8%. But within a year, Tyleonol had regained and surprassed its previous market share. Today, this case is used in business schools as an example of how to respond to negative publicity. Even though Tylenol is just generic acetominephen, it still enjoys non-commodity pricing power because of consumer\u2019s positive associations.</p><p>In contrast, in 1994 Professor Thomas Nicely of Lynchburg College reported to Intel some strange results in calculations he was performing with Pentium chips. Intel, after some delays, acknowledged the bug, but minimized the issue, initially saying it was a rare condition and most users would not experience the bug. Under pressure, Intel agreed to replace faulty Pentium chips but only if users could demonstrate that they were affected by the bug.</p><p><span id=\"more-24692\"></span></p><p>This news broke not long after Intel\u2019s initial Pentium sales campaign, which featured the \u201cbunny suit\u201d commercials, lavish channel spending on promotion, the Intel Inside campaign, and that tedious four-note theme. All of that massive spending could not outcompete nightly CNN stories, David Letterman \u201cTop Ten Pentium Bugs\u201d monologues, and wide news coverage. After more heel-dragging, Intel announced it would replace any Pentium chip on demand (an offer very few customers bothered with), but the damage was already done. In the end, Intel took a $730 million (2020 dollars) charge.</p><p>What do these two episodes in business history teach us?</p><p><strong>1. If you have bad news, don\u2019t cover it up.</strong> If you\u2019ve been hacked, or if you have some unexpected downtime, customers and potential customers appreciate honesty. For example, BuyVM (a well-respected provider) once had a set of bad power supplies that took down many nodes. The BuyVM team worked long and hard to get everyone\u2019s service restored, and through it all kept posting regular updates. As a result, they received a lot of praise for their transparency.</p><p>On the other hand, there have been many providers who denied or minimized problems have seen their brands damaged when the truth comes out because it breaks trust.</p><p><strong>2. Sweeping things under the rug costs more in the long run.</strong> If Intel had immediately said \u201cyes, errata in chips is common, we acknowledge the error, and we\u2019ll replace any defective chip,\u201d there would have been little coverage outside of obscure engineering journals and very few customers would have taken them up on it. By resisting any concession, Intel eventually spent $730m and enduring brand damage.</p><p><strong>3. One piece of bad news is better than many pieces of bad news.</strong> It\u2019s painful to announce \u201cwe had some nodes go down\u201d or \u201cwe got hacked\u201d. But it\u2019s better to get all the bad news out at once than to die by a million cuts as new revelations dribble out daily.</p><p><strong>4. Brands can recover from everything except broken trust.</strong> Things don\u2019t get much worse for a brand than \u201cour headache medicine can kill you\u201d. Yet, J&amp;J bounced back through honesty and focusing on the customer experience rather than short-term profits. If you take a blow, acknowledge the issue, think long-term, and put your customers first.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fprovider-911-responding-when-something-bad-has-happened%2F&amp;t=Provider%20911%3A%20Responding%20When%20Something%20Bad%20Has%20Happened\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Provider%20911%3A%20Responding%20When%20Something%20Bad%20Has%20Happened&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fprovider-911-responding-when-something-bad-has-happened%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Fprovider-911-responding-when-something-bad-has-happened%2F&amp;title=Provider%20911%3A%20Responding%20When%20Something%20Bad%20Has%20Happened&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">4</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/provider-911-how-do-i-stand-out-in-the-market/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
