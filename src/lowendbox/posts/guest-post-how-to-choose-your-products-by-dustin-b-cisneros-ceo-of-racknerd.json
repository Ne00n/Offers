Cisneros from </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about how to choose your products as a business. Are you planning to start a new business, or do you already have an existing business that you would like to refine and grow? If so, we believe that you\u2019ll be able to take home some advantageous tips that you can start implementing today from this article.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps you\u2019re entering a marketplace with little to no experience, or maybe you\u2019re already in the marketplace but are in confusion on what products you should be offering, or are already missing. Truth be told, you\u2019re going to have to confront sales \u2013 everything in life is a sale. To be successful in business, you are going to have to learn how to sell, what to sell, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what to avoid selling.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1)</span> <b>Products are important, you need multiple:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a web hosting provider. In this example, you currently sell shared hosting which essentially is a product that helps businesses have a web presence on the internet, at some point you\u2019re going to need to consider offering domain registration, this way, new businesses or those looking to create a new website can consider you a one-stop shop whereby they can order their domain with you, along with the shared hosting \u2013 versus the customer having to obtain the services from multiple providers. Making the process easier for the customer, makes the customer sticky to you! These customers then renew these services for years to come, or if you\u2019re able to sell these businesses services with prepayment terms, do it. This allows customers to secure the best rates with you while reducing your overall churn. The concept is simple, and while this may not be your \u201cniche\u201d or desired customer in the hosting industry, you need to start thinking similar for whichever is your niche market. This is just a simple yet easy to understand example. You need multiple products, to increase opportunity and revenue. You need products that are scalable and allow for easy entry as a customer, which later can be sold another suitable service as their business grows with you. This could as an example be shared hosting -&gt; virtual private servers -&gt; dedicated servers -&gt; private cloud. The upgrade and growth pattern for the customer is there, as needed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2)</span> <b>Knowing what products you should not sell: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I mention above it is important to have multiple products to sell, it is also very important to know what products you </span><b>shouldn\u2019t</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sell. Here\u2019s why: you enter the marketplace, and try to offer every product possible, but the truth is your sales team and maybe even you, aren\u2019t familiar with all of the products, technology and so forth you\u2019re offering. This leads to immediate confusion, and lack of confidence within the organization. Confusion leads to loss of production, revenue. And if customers are sold the wrong products, which surprisingly happens a lot, likely even in your organization today you lose customers without knowing. Those cancellations you may be seeing from your customers today \u2013 there\u2019s a real reason behind those, and those reasons often times aren\u2019t exposed to you. </span><b>Confront what you\u2019re capable of supporting, not just selling.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Your team\u2019s talent should help you brainstorm which products are best suited for your organization to offer. Do this now, confront it, and you\u2019ll thank me later!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3)</span> <b>When to move away from a product you currently offer: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important as a business owner that you\u2019re committed to your organization, and updated with technology. What may have sold years ago, and worked years ago, may not be the solution today. Be sure to know when it\u2019s time to move away from a product, when to upsell customers, when to upgrade customers at no cost, whatever is required \u2013 this is something you\u2019ll need to confront and make a business decision on as you continue to grow with the current times and market trends. For example, in the hosting industry, providers who offer OpenVZ have shifted to KVM, due to demand, flexibility and have confront that OpenVZ is no longer a desirable virtualization platform. Providers who still try and maintain their existing dated infrastructure and technology are being left behind without knowing it, or confronting it. Don\u2019t let this happen to you. Know when to pivot. Nothing ever remains the same, it either improves or gets worse.</span></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4)</span> <b>Don\u2019t try and do this all alone. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While my tips may be great, and you\u2019re starting to brainstorm and think about your next opportunity \u2013 it is important to know you can\u2019t do this all alone. Brainstorm with your team, share your goals, with the eagerness and drive to innovate. You\u2019ll be surprised by the feedback your team provides, oftentimes resulting in rewarding new products. Most importantly, engage with your customers, vendors, and find out what products your customers want you to offer. You can conduct customer surveys for them to fill out so that you can evaluate and fulfill the demand from there. That\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re expecting long term growth, and sticky customers (ones that stick around for years). Lastly, don\u2019t forget about your vendors. They\u2019re constantly innovating and coming up with new products that may help take your business to the next level. How can you leverage your vendors or partners\u2019 products? Communication and creativity are key.</span></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>5)</b> <b>Increase value delivery for your customers: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get creative and figure out how you can add additional value on top of the existing products you offer to your customers today. For example, on </span><a href=\"https://www.racknerd.com/reseller-hosting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RackNerd\u2019s shared/reseller hosting lineup</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we recently added JetBackup offsite backups, and MailChannels outbound mail delivery for all new and existing customers, all at no additional charge. This was on top of everything else we already included, such as CloudLinux, LiteSpeed Web Server, Softaculous one click script installers, etc. By doing this, you are creating features that your customers/value-added resellers can leverage and begin promoting not only for themselves but for their end-users, which results in growth for them and you. This is simply a real example of something that we did recently, but this concept really applies to any industry and any type of product offering. Continuing to stay in communication with your customers, and enhancing your services is a surefire way to make sure your customers continue to remain satisfied and stick with you in the long run. After all, just remember that your customer\u2019s success is your success.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are already in business, or are looking to enter the business and are intrigued by the hosting industry, feel free to e-mail me at dustin@racknerd.com or </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustincisneros/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">connect with me on LinkedIn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to chat and leverage each other\u2019s talents.
