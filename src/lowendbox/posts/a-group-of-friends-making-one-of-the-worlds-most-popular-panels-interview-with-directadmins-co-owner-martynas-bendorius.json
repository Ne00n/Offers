We\u2019ve always done our best to keep the product top-notch, however, it was<br>\nwrong to focus everything on the backend code. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve employed dedicated people working on frontend \ud83d\ude42&nbsp; We\u2019re glad that frontend part of our product is top-notch as well, it\u2019s a single-page-application, all written in Vue.</p><p><strong>Going back a few months, cPanel had a huge price hike. That had to be a tremendous </strong><strong>opportunity for you guys. How has that benefitted DA?</strong></p><p>Some exposure, and lots of pressure. We started to look for new talent for the team. This month we had 4 new colleagues here. We feel the demand.</p><p><strong>I have to put you on the spot because the question comes up. Does DA intend to go to per-</strong><strong>domain or per-user licensing?</strong></p><p>We have no plans for this at the moment. If the future brings 4TB RAM servers with 512 CPU cores that could host hundreds of thousands hosting customers \u2013 we\u2019d just start discussing it with the community.</p><p><strong>Unlike some of your competition, DA supports many different operating systems. That has to be a lot more work in terms of QA, development, etc. Why do you take this approach?</strong></p><p>You are totally right. At first we did not know which distribution is going to be the most popular \ud83d\ude42&nbsp; Now we know that it\u2019s definitely Linux (CentOS/AlmaLinux,<br>\nDebian and Ubuntu). We have no official plans to support FreeBSD13, as we\u2019re thinking to dedicate more of our time for Linux development.</p><p><strong>Your software downloads and builds your own versions of web servers, etc. from scratch.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Why do that instead of basing your work off the distro\u2019s own package managers?</strong></p><p>We patch the software to support some specific features. For example \u2013 suexec in Apache to support per-directory user definition or linux cgroups. It\u2019s possible to use our own repositories and packages for this, but newest packages would need to be packaged by us. At this time, for example, customers can simply download any version of php from php.net, specify custom version \u2013 and they get it installed. We\u2019re thinking about providing a selection (compilation or OS packages from our repositories) in the future, but we have no ETA on this yet.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.directadmin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1OTYiIGhlaWdodD0iMjkwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTk2IDI5MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-26747 alignleft\" data-src=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/da_logo.png.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"290\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"20\" data-srcset=\"https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/da_logo.png.webp 596w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/da_logo-300x146.png.webp 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px\"></a>What\u2019s your company culture like inside?</strong></p><p>Very relaxed, like a group of friends. :) We are the same people from the beginning and we do not have outside owners or investors. The culture is what we want it to be. This can make the hiring process more difficult because someone being a good fit personally is just as important as their skills technically.</p><p><strong>My perception is that DA as a company is a lot smaller than cPanel. Do you see yourselves as </strong><strong>the underdog in the panel market?</strong></p><p>Yes, we are much smaller for size and market share. This can be an advantage, so we can control our growth to a reasonable pace. Too much &amp; too fast means burning out. Some people ask why we are not more aggressive, but this can lead to problems.</p><p><strong>Every now and then, I see posts on LowEndTalk about how panels are going away and in X </strong><strong>years, because \u201cthe big clouds\u201d will make hosting a web site so easy that the current model of </strong><strong>getting an account and managing it with DA or cPanel will no longer be needed. What are </strong><strong>your thoughts on the future of \u201ctraditional shared hosting\u201d?</strong></p><p>Things have changed, for sure. There was no cloud computing when we started, and even VPS was a new &amp; experimental thing. :) Back then, control panels were simpler too. I think there is still demand for control panels because they have become more complex and do more things.</p><p><strong>Have you been following the DA \u201cproduct improvements\u201d thread on LowEndTalk? Have you </strong><strong>taken any plans from it?</strong></p><p>Yes, I follow that thread and many adjustments/new features were implemented because of the feedback in that thread. I\u2019d like to thank the community for their time/efforts there.</p><p><strong>I imagine one of your nightmares is a security vulnerability that results in DA sites being </strong><strong>compromised. What\u2019s your recipe for keeping DA sites safe?</strong></p><p>We implement additional security measures like bubblewrap to isolate user environments. In addition to this, we\u2019re working on complete user isolation on the control panel side. It would be technically impossible to escape your own user isolation when executing anything under DirectAdmin. No one is fully protected, but we do as much as we can to keep DirectAdmin secure. This includes yearly security audits to the codebase.</p><p><strong>The cPanel ecosystem of add-ons, plugins, etc. is significantly larger than DA\u2019s. Are you </strong><strong>interested in growing the DA marketplace or are you more interested in adding features to </strong><strong>the product itself?</strong></p><p>Most of the time native features work the best, so we\u2019d like to get more and more of them into our codebase.</p><p>Also, we do not chase after others to make plugins/add-ons. Any 3rd party software for DA exists because somebody thought it would be useful and valuable. Any growth of this sort is natural. Some people say organic, but it reminds me of food. :)</p><p><strong>Where do you see DA in 5\u202610\u202620 years?</strong></p><p>DA is almost 20 years old so another 20 would be great. :) We are the same people who started this from the beginning and this is our job. We don\u2019t want to do anything else. It is difficult to say what the future will be. One thing for sure, people will keep giving feedback and requests,so we will never run out of things to do.</p><p><strong>Anything else you\u2019d like to tell us about DirectAdmin?</strong></p><p>I forgot to mention earlier, I started off as a stranger to DA. I joined the forum, became a contributor, and then an owner. It is nice to have my efforts recognized but this is not why I mention it.</p><p>I mention it because this is so opposite of the things going on now. People are nervous about control panels for reasons of business ethics. They ask us, will we change pricing structure, or sell to investors. But look at our decisions almost two decades later. Instead of selling out to strangers, a long-term contributor and friend gets formal recognition &amp; ownership. I think such things would scare investors. :) We are as much a group of friends as we are a business entity.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks, Martynas for the insights!&nbsp; Be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.directadmin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DirectAdmin</a> and also the rest of <a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/category/interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview series</a> for more insights from industry and community leaders.</em></p><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/automating-mysql_secure_installation-in-mariadb-setup/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Automating mysql_secure_installation in MariaDB Setup\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/leb-centered-small.jpg) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Automating mysql_secure_installation in MariaDB Setup</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/comment-free-for-all-which-obscure-linux-distro-do-you-regularly-use-2/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"Comment Free For All: Which Obscure Linux Distro Do You Regularly Use?\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/comment-free-for-all-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">Comment Free For All: Which Obscure Linux Distro Do You Regularly Use?</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/lowendtalk-offers-weekly-roundup-april-24-2021/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"LowEndTalk Offers Weekly Roundup (April 24, 2021)\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lowendtalk-roundup-1-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">LowEndTalk Offers Weekly Roundup (April 24, 2021)</div></div></a><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/hostbastic-for-the-price-of-a-cup-of-coffee-host-for-a-year-with-directadmin-in-singapore-london-usa/\"><div class=\"relpost-custom-block-single\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 215px;\"><div class=\"relpost-block-single-image\" alt=\"HostBastic: For the Price of a Cup of Coffee, Host for a Year with DirectAdmin in Singapore/London/U...\" style=\"background: transparent url(https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hostbastic-150x150.png) no-repeat scroll 0% 0%; width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-single-text\" style=\"font-family: Arial;  font-size: 12px;  color: #333333;\">HostBastic: For the Price of a Cup of Coffee, Host for a Year with DirectAdmin in Singapore/London/U...</div></div></a></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div></div></div><div id=\"author-bio-box\" style=\"background: #f8f8f8; border-top: 2px solid #cccccc; border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc; color: #333333\"><h3><a style=\"color: #555555;\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/author/raindog308/\" title=\"All posts by raindog308\" rel=\"author\">raindog308</a></h3><div class=\"bio-gravatar\"><img data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwIDcwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=70&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg\" data-srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce3b8640a70e05bd73ac25b8a37821c?s=140&amp;d=retro&amp;r=pg 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-70 photo\" height=\"70\" width=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/raindog308\" class=\"bio-icon bio-icon-website\"></a><p class=\"bio-description\">I'm Andrew, techno polymath and long-time LowEndTalk community Moderator.
