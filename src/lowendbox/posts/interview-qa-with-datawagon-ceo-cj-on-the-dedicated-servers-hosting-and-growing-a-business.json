Today, as we continue the series, we sit down with CJ Sculti, CEO of DataWagon. So let\u2019s get started with the interview!</span></p><p><strong>What can you tell us about yourself, how you got to where you are today, and your role at your company?</strong></p><p>From a young age computers and the internet were always passions of mine. I bought a .99 cent shared web hosting plan in my early teenage years, and decided that I wanted to learn anything and everything that I could about hosting. I eventually upgraded to a VPS, then to a dedicated server, and then decided that I wanted to get into the hosting business myself. In 2014, when I was sixteen years old, I registered DataWagon LLC and started my company. I started off with a single dedicated server providing VPS and shared hosting. Today, DataWagon owns and operates hundreds of servers across multiple datacenters in the United States. I\u2019ve dedicated the last six years of my life to making this happen, and I\u2019m eager to continue leading DataWagon into the future!</p><p><span id=\"more-22285\"></span></p><p><strong>What advice would you give to business owners today, or those aspiring to become one?</strong></p><p>The first piece of advice that I\u2019d give to any aspiring entrepreneur is to always believe in yourself and your idea. I know it sounds cliche, but in my opinion, it really is one of the most important things to running a successful business. When DataWagon was still in its early years, I <em>never</em> expected it to get as big as it was today.&nbsp; When I first started, I can recall looking at bigger hosts that had their own infrastructure and thinking that DataWagon would never get to that size. One day I just decided \u201cYou know what, I can do this and I\u2019m going to,\u201d and that\u2019s what I did. Today, DataWagon is one of those companies that I thought it never would be. It\u2019s easy to doubt and discourage yourself, especially when you have big goals, but to achieve big goals, you have to believe that you can. The second piece of advice that goes hand in hand with this is to stay patient. Things aren\u2019t going to happen overnight; some things are going to take way longer than you want them to. Don\u2019t let it discourage you. Stick to your plan, trust the process, work hard, and you will achieve your goal.</p><p><strong>Would you recommend the hosting industry as a source of opportunity for entrepreneurs?</strong></p><p>If hosting is something that you\u2019re passionate about, then yes, I would 100% recommend the hosting industry as a source of opportunity. If hosting isn\u2019t something that\u2019s in your background though, then be sure to do your research, and make sure you know your stuff before starting a hosting company. The hosting industry is unique in that the customer puts a tremendous amount of trust in their host. They trust you with the security of their personal data and reachability of their website or services. Don\u2019t betray the client\u2019s trust by selling them a service that you\u2019re not an expert in configuring and managing. The hosting industry is also super competitive, so you have to do your research, find your niche, and make sure you stand out from the crowd. It\u2019s certainly not the easiest industry to be in, but if you\u2019re passionate about it, there\u2019s nothing more rewarding.</p><p><strong>What is the most significant characteristic that makes your company unique in today\u2019s evolving market landscape?</strong></p><p>One thing that sets DataWagon apart from the competition is our DDoS mitigation platform. We\u2019ve developed the platform from scratch over the past two years, and are very happy with where it\u2019s at currently. We have a ton of customers that have switched to us from other DDoS protected hosts and tell us that our platform is the only one they\u2019ve tried that successfully protected their service from certain DDoS attacks. We\u2019ve spent tons of time tuning the filter, and are able to add new rules via eBPF syntax on the fly to block attacks that we haven\u2019t seen before. The mitigation devices run on the edge of our network and can process packets at line rate using Intel DPDK.</p><p><strong>What do you enjoy most about your role? What do you find most difficult?</strong></p><p>What I enjoy most about my role at DataWagon is interacting with our current and future clients. I love making deals and providing people with a service that they need at a price that they\u2019re going to be happy with. I\u2019m sure any business owner will tell you the same, but to me, there is nothing more gratifying than having a customer utilize and rely on your service, and be happy with it. The most difficult thing that I have to do is deny orders when we\u2019re out of stock. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than having to tell someone \u2018we can\u2019t help you out\u2019 when they come to you requesting something that we can\u2019t provide at the time.</p><p><strong>Both personally and professionally, what guiding principles ground you?</strong></p><p>In both my personal and professional life, honesty and integrity are two principles that guide me. In the hosting industry, there is certainly a lot of room for dishonesty, and it happens more often than we\u2019d like. If I don\u2019t feel that what I\u2019m doing is fair and honest, then I\u2019m not going to do it. DataWagon is never going to be the company that marks up a service 1000% simply because the client doesn\u2019t know that they could get the same thing elsewhere for 10x cheaper. I always try to keep our pricing fair, for us, and our clients.</p><p><strong>Tell me about some of the new and exciting things you are working on at your company?</strong></p><p>We\u2019ve recently overhauled our customer experience with the release of our new DataWagon Cloud panel. The public beta just recently released, and we\u2019re looking to roll out the full version as soon as we can. We\u2019ve completely replaced the WHMCS billing system with our new panel that\u2019s been designed from the ground up. Clients can now manage their billing, dedicated servers, and VPS all from one panel. Clients can automatically reinstall their dedicated servers, access KVM over IPMI, manage which IPs are routed over our firewall, set rDNS records, view DDoS attack history, and do a ton more from the new panel. We also have a lot of new features on our roadmap for this upcoming year, including live dedicated server listings with instant setup, block storage for dedicated servers and VPS, and custom BPF firewall rules for clients.</p><p>Instant setup dedicated server offerings are something that we\u2019re going to be rolling out in the near future. Automation is something that we\u2019ve always been big on at DataWagon. It allows us to keep our costs down, and saves valuable time for our clients. At this point, we\u2019ve basically automated the whole process of provisioning a dedicated server. Soon, clients will be able to buy a dedicated server and have it provisioned with their operating system of choice (Linux or Windows), and their requested size IP block, all in under 15 minutes from the time of payment.</p><p>Something else to look out for is our revamped VPS offerings that we\u2019ll be releasing soon. Our new VPS packages will run on blazing fast AMD Ryzen 3950x powered nodes with RAID10 NVMe storage. We\u2019ve spent months testing and optimizing our setup to provide our clients with the best possible performance in a virtualized environment. On top of the great hardware, clients will have access to our custom management panel that lets them view VPS stats, upload custom ISOs, and do tons more.</p><p><strong>Why should customers trust you and your business?</strong></p><p>Personally, I take privacy and security very seriously. Naturally, this translates into how I run my business. At DataWagon, we\u2019re dedicated to preserving the privacy of our customers by all means necessary. Under no circumstances do we give out any client data unless we receive a verified subpoena from law enforcement requesting it. Additionally, we are huge advocates for free speech. The world is full of people who want to silence those that they don\u2019t agree with, but at DataWagon, we\u2019re dedicated to protecting your right to free speech. We are not, and don\u2019t try to be the arbiter of the internet, like many ISPs do. Even if we don\u2019t agree with something you host, as long as your content is legal and safe, we will have your back.</p><p><strong>Final thoughts and anything you would like to add?</strong></p><p>I\u2019d like to thank @jbiloh for giving me the opportunity to participate in this interview series. I hope that I\u2019ve given the community a bit more insight into who I am, and how we do things at DataWagon!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you\u2019d like to learn more about DataWagon you may do so by visiting their <a href=\"https://datawagon.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a>.</p><p class=\"dpsp-share-text\"></p><div id=\"dpsp-content-bottom\" class=\"dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-rounded dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-1 dpsp-has-icon-background dpsp-has-button-background dpsp-show-total-share-count dpsp-show-total-share-count-after\"><ul class=\"dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-has-button-icon-animation\"><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-datawagon-ceo-cj-on-the-dedicated-servers-hosting-and-growing-a-business%2F&amp;t=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Datawagon%20CEO%20CJ%20Sculti%20on%20Being%20a%20Young%20Entrepreneur%2C%20Learning%20on%20the%20Job%20and%20Becoming%20Successful\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first\" title=\"Share on Facebook\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Datawagon%20CEO%20CJ%20Sculti%20on%20Being%20a%20Young%20Entrepreneur%2C%20Learning%20on%20the%20Job%20and%20Becoming%20Successful&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-datawagon-ceo-cj-on-the-dedicated-servers-hosting-and-growing-a-business%2F&amp;via=LowEndNetwork\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label\" title=\"Share on Twitter\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Flowendbox.com%2Fblog%2Finterview-qa-with-datawagon-ceo-cj-on-the-dedicated-servers-hosting-and-growing-a-business%2F&amp;title=Interview%3A%20Q%26A%20with%20Datawagon%20CEO%20CJ%20Sculti%20on%20Being%20a%20Young%20Entrepreneur%2C%20Learning%20on%20the%20Job%20and%20Becoming%20Successful&amp;mini=true\" class=\"dpsp-network-btn dpsp-linkedin dpsp-no-label dpsp-last\" title=\"Share on LinkedIn\"><span class=\"dpsp-network-icon\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-network-label-wrapper\"></span></a></li></ul><div class=\"dpsp-total-share-wrapper\"><span class=\"dpsp-icon-total-share\"></span><span class=\"dpsp-total-share-count\">1</span><span>shares</span></div></div><div class=\"relpost-thumb-wrapper\"><div class=\"relpost-thumb-container\"><h3>Related posts:</h3><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div style=\"clear: both\"></div><div class=\"relpost-block-container\"><a class=\"relpost-block-single\" href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/interview-qa-with-dedipath-cto-ernie-quick-on-his-company-and-making-success-happen/\"><div style=\"width: 150px;
