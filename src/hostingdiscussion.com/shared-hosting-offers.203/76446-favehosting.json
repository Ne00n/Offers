It is one of the most eco-friendly datacenter in the world, as can be seen from its energy efficiency record (PUE of 1.09). Servers require considerable amounts of electricity to operate and need constant cooling to prevent overheating. In most places, this electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels, which creates emissions that accelerate climate change. The experts think that datacenters will make up 10% of global electricity usage by 2030, and generate more emissions than the entire airline industry. You can fight climate change by using our products.<br>\n<br>\nAll of our green shared hosting plans include free DDoS protection. It provides your websites with round-the-clock protection against all types of DDoS attack, without any limitations in terms of volume or duration.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Use PROMO code HD-S21 for 25% OFF recurring</b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><div class=\"bbTable\">\n<table style=\"width: 100%\"><tbody><tr><td><br>\n<b>Basic<br>\n$1.50</b> per month (25% OFF with promo code)<br>\n<b>$16.20</b> per year (another 10% OFF)<br>\n<br>\n<u>INFORMATION:</u><br>\n1 Website<br>\n5 GB NVMe SSD Storage<br>\n<br>\n<u>RESOURCE LIMITS:</u><br>\nNumber Of CPUs - 1<br>\nRAM - 1 GB<br>\nMB/sec (IO) - 20 MB/s<br>\nOperations Per Second (IOPS) - 1024<br>\nMax Number Of Processes (NPROC) - 100<br>\nEntry Processes (EP) - 40<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.favehosting.com/green-shared-hosting.php?utm_source=HD&amp;utm_medium=advert&amp;utm_campaign=FH\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Order here</a></td><td><br>\n<b>Deluxe<br>\n$2.63</b> per month (25% OFF with promo code)<br>\n<b>$28.35</b> per year (another 10% OFF)<br>\n<br>\n<u>INFORMATION:</u><br>\n5 Websites<br>\n10 GB NVMe SSD Storage<br>\n<br>\n<u>RESOURCE LIMITS:</u><br>\nNumber Of CPUs - 2<br>\nRAM - 2 GB<br>\nMB/sec (IO) - 30 MB/s<br>\nOperations Per Second (IOPS) - 1536<br>\nMax Number Of Processes (NPROC) - 150<br>\nEntry Processes (EP) - 60<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.favehosting.com/green-shared-hosting.php?utm_source=HD&amp;utm_medium=advert&amp;utm_campaign=FH\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Order here</a></td><td><br>\n<b>Premium<br>\n$3.75</b> per month (25% OFF with promo code)<br>\n<b>$40.50</b> per year (another 10% OFF)<br>\n<br>\n<u>INFORMATION:</u><br>\nUnlimited Websites<br>\n20 GB NVMe SSD Storage<br>\n<br>\n<u>RESOURCE LIMITS:</u><br>\nNumber Of CPUs - 3<br>\nRAM - 3 GB<br>\nMB/sec (IO) - 40 MB/s<br>\nOperations Per Second (IOPS) - 2048<br>\nMax Number Of Processes (NPROC) - 200<br>\nEntry Processes (EP) - 80<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.favehosting.com/green-shared-hosting.php?utm_source=HD&amp;utm_medium=advert&amp;utm_campaign=FH\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Order here</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div></div><br>\n<br>\n<u><b>Included Features:</b></u><br>\n<br>\n\u2605 <b>cPanel control panel</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>Litespeed web server with LSCache</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>CloudLinux operating system</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>Softaculous installer</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>JetBackup plugin</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>Free SSL certificate (Let's encrypt)</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>99.9% uptime guarantee</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>Free website migration</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>24/7 Ticket based Support</b><br>\n\u2605 <b>30 days money back guarantee</b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u><b>About FaveHosting.com</b></u><br>\n<br>\nFaveHosting.com is a property of Castordor, a registered business in the province of Quebec, Canada.<br>\nBusiness number (NEQ): 2275092346<br>\n<br>\nFaveHosting.com has been created by a small group of web technicians who used to work for another company but they decided to create their own.
