When measuring Magento in similar tests, Litespeed\u2019s LiteMage outperforms Apache+Turpentine by 33X. That\u2019s unbeatable performance that your users and admins can see and feel. LiteSpeed conserves resources without sacrificing performance, security, compatibility, or convenience. Double the maximum capacity of Apache servers with LiteSpeed Web Server\u2019s streamlined event-driven architecture, capable of handling thousands of concurrent clients with minimal memory consumption and CPU usage.<br>\n<br>\n<b>We include LSCache</b><br>\n<br>\nLSCache accelerates dynamic content (not just PHP pages), with features very similar to those in Apache mod_cache, using an efficient, highly customizable, native implementation within LiteSpeed Web Server. LSCache eliminates the extra reverse-proxy layer(s) required by add-on cache packages (such as Varnish), providing faster, more efficient handling of static content in addition to its stellar handling of dynamic content. LSCache is the solution for a faster, more enjoyable user experience. If you\u2019re experiencing performance issues with Xenforo, Prestashop, WooCommerce or Magento, then upgrade to LiteSpeed + LSCache. You\u2019ll see an immediate improvement in your website\u2019s performance.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our PCIe NVMe + LiteSpeed Connection</b><br>\n<br>\nNVMe SSD is a performance based solution. Traditional storage requires an ACHI (SATA) or SAS controller to connect mechanical hard disks to the PCIe bus, but NVMe eliminates that bridge and instead makes a direct connection. Regular SSD was an older performance based solution because the latency or response time of the storage media improved drastically over mechanical drives, by as much a thousand times. Conversely, the bottleneck with under-performing NVMe is the SATA interface. When establishing a direct connection to PCIe, NVMe outperforms regular SSD by 6 times. Combined with LiteSpeed, this equates to server performance that the user can see and feel.<br>\n<br>\n<b>cPanel\u00ae is our hosting platform</b><br>\n<br>\ncPanel\u00ae is currently the most popular control panel on the market, because it simply works.
