In contrast to every other provider, you WILL NOT be automatically billed at the end of your trial period. Let us prove to you that our service is everything we say it is. If it isn't, simply allow your trial to run out.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why choose LiteSpeed for your website?</b><br>\n<br>\nWe offer the choice of Apache or LiteSpeed, so you can choose which best suits your application. WordPress sites perform faster with LiteSpeed, while Apache has great application compatibility. Both configurations come with ample NVMe storage, and lots of features like unlimited bandwidth, add-on domains, FTP accounts, emails and Maria databases. <br>\n<br>\n<b>LiteSpeed Plan</b><br>\n<br>\n10Gb of storage space<br>\nUnlimited bandwidth<br>\nUnlimited email accounts<br>\nUnlimited add-on domains<br>\nOur servers are NEVER OVERSOLD<br>\nTriple Replication<br>\ncPanel control panel<br>\nHassle free migratiions<br>\nFREE SSL <br>\nLSCache included<br>\nSelectable version of PHP<br>\nOne-click script installer<br>\n24x7 Forever support by phone, email and live chat<br>\n<br>\n<b>$15/Month or $150/Year USD</b><br>\n<br>\nRisk FREE 7 Day Trial <b><a href=\"https://my.hostirian.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=137\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">FREE 7 DAY TRIAL</a></b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Apache Plan</b><br>\n<br>\n10Gb of storage space<br>\nUnlimited bandwidth<br>\nUnlimited email accounts<br>\nUnlimited add-on domains<br>\nOur servers are NEVER OVERSOLD<br>\nTriple Replication<br>\ncPanel control panel<br>\nHassle free migratiions<br>\nFREE SSL <br>\nSelectable version of PHP<br>\nOne-click script installer<br>\n24x7 Forever support by phone, email and live chat<br>\n<br>\n<b>$10/Month or $100/Year USD</b><br>\nRisk FREE 7 Day Trial <b><a href=\"https://my.hostirian.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=135\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">FREE 7 DAY TRIAL</a></b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Why LiteSpeed</b><br>\n<br>\nIn bench tests measuring WordPress transactions per second, Litespeed\u2019s LSCache outperforms Apache by 90X. When measuring Magento in similar tests, Litespeed\u2019s LiteMage outperforms Apache+Turpentine by 33X. That\u2019s unbeatable performance that your users and admins can see and feel. LiteSpeed conserves resources without sacrificing performance, security, compatibility, or convenience. Double the maximum capacity of Apache servers with LiteSpeed Web Server\u2019s streamlined event-driven architecture, capable of handling thousands of concurrent clients with minimal memory consumption and CPU usage.<br>\n<br>\n<b>We include LSCache</b><br>\n<br>\nLSCache accelerates dynamic content (not just PHP pages), with features very similar to those in Apache mod_cache, using an efficient, highly customizable, native implementation within LiteSpeed Web Server. LSCache eliminates the extra reverse-proxy layer(s) required by add-on cache packages (such as Varnish), providing faster, more efficient handling of static content in addition to its stellar handling of dynamic content. LSCache is the solution for a faster, more enjoyable user experience. If you\u2019re experiencing performance issues with Xenforo, Prestashop, WooCommerce or Magento, then upgrade to LiteSpeed + LSCache. You\u2019ll see an immediate improvement in your website\u2019s performance.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our PCIe NVMe + LiteSpeed Connection</b><br>\n<br>\nNVMe SSD is a performance based solution. Traditional storage requires an ACHI (SATA) or SAS controller to connect mechanical hard disks to the PCIe bus, but NVMe eliminates that bridge and instead makes a direct connection. Regular SSD was an older performance based solution because the latency or response time of the storage media improved drastically over mechanical drives, by as much a thousand times. Conversely, the bottleneck with under-performing NVMe is the SATA interface. When establishing a direct connection to PCIe, NVMe outperforms regular SSD by 6 times. Combined with LiteSpeed, this equates to server performance that the user can see and feel.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why Apache</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Consistently reliable</b><br>\n<br>\nInstead of implementing a single architecture, Apache provides a variety of MultiProcessing Modules (MPMs), which allow Apache to run in a process-based, hybrid (process and thread) or event-hybrid mode, to better match the demands of each particular infrastructure. Where compromises in performance need to be made, the design of Apache is to reduce latency and increase throughput, relative to simply handling more requests, thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time-frames. This translates to superior visitor experiences while viewing your website.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our PCIe NVMe + Apache Connection</b><br>\n<br>\nNVMe SSD is a performance based solution.
