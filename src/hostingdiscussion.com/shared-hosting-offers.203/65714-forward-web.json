Anything related to your website, Forward Web will be happy to assist. <br>\n <br>\n<br>\n<b>2. We understand </b>that without a stable and fast web hosting platform, you will not be able to effectively market or even operate your business. This means we work very hard to insure our network IP\u2019s remain clean, our server hardware remain up-to date and that your content is served in the fastest most efficient manner possible. Your business can rest easy knowing Forward Web will always do its best to insure we are not just meeting, but exceeding industry standards. <br>\n <br>\n<b><br>\n3.

We take your websites serious, therefore we take our server hardware and network serious. <br>\n<br>\nWhere are our servers located? Formally the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, our servers are located in the most secure data center in the central United States. Our data center is located in the heart of downtown Dallas, TX. It is in a Tier 3+ facility on the same protected power grid as Dallas 911 and the local hospitals. This means our DC is exempt from rolling blackouts that historically have been an occurrence due to the Texas summer heat. Power is sent to the data center from four different substations, requiring all four substations to go offline before power to the building is interrupted. Additionally, the data center is serviced by water feeds from the north and south of the building. If you want your website hosted with Speed, security and redundancy in mind (built for enterprise), yet priced for the small business. Then Forward Web is the company for you.<br>\n<br>\n** Paypal, Credit/Debit Card and Bitcoin accepted **<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forwardweb.net/contact-forward-web/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"><b>Questions?
