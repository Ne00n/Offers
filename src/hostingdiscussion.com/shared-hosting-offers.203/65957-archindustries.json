We\u2019re constantly expanding and adding new features.<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>Security</u></b><br>\nYour file safety and online security is our top priority. We utilize signed AES 256 SSL encryption on all web services. Our infrastructure has been tested for vulnerabilities by multiple penetration testers and secured against attacks (Apache symlink attacks, hypervisor exploits). Our configuration includes routine backups to offsite locations to ensure that client data is not lost in the event of a hard drive failure.<br>\n<br>\nSensitive client data is secured with military-grade AES encryption. All passwords are salted numerous times to ensure maximum security. Our set of in-house developers helps prevent us from being vulnerable to the same \"zero-day\" attacks that other providers may face. No credit card or sensitive billing information is kept on file, preventing any possibility of leaked credit card or financial data due to a security breach.<br>\n<br>\nWe utilize CloudLinux OS which provides numerous improved security benefits over CentOS. Most significantly is the utilization of CageFS, which provides your website dedicated resources and a jailed environment that\u2019s completely separate from any other user on the server. Just because you\u2019re on a shared server doesn\u2019t mean you need to compromise security!<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>Support</u></b><br>\nDo you need a WordPress blog installed?
