It\u2019s because we actually use the paid web hosting control panel, named cPanel.<br>\n<br>\nNo Adverts - We don\u2019t advertise on client websites, we never have, and we never will. <br>\n<br>\nAround The Clock Support - We are not like most free hosting providers who take days to answer your tickets, or restrict you to support via forums only. We provide support though ticket to all clients and we aim to respond to tickets within 6 hours.<br>\n<br>\nNo File Size Limitations - We don\u2019t limit file sizes on any of our plans. However, using our service as a file hosting platform will result in your account being suspended.<br>\n<br>\nTo order your free hosting account visit <a href=\"https://VimlyHost.net\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">https://VimlyHost.net</a> and signup.<br>\n<br>\nIf you have any questions about our services, you can contact us through Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Email or Ticket at anytime.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Editor Notes</b><br>\n<br>\nManual Activation - Please create a ticket with the \u2018Activation Team\u2019 after ordering your account, to explain your websites purpose. Otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to activate your account.<br>\n<br>\nIf your wondering how we can offer free hosting, please read our explanation attached below.<br>\n<br>\nWe have a number of partners that allow us to provide our free hosting, in return for advertisment of their paid services. <br>\n<br>\nThese advertisements are only placed on our website in the form of non-intrusive banners and third-party upgrade links. We do not currently advertise directly within cPanel, and we have no plans to advertise on clients websites.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition to these advertisements, most customers don't fully utilise the space provided to them, and although we can fully provision space for all customers, it's unlikely to occur.<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, we can safely oversell our free services without effecting the performance of our services.</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
