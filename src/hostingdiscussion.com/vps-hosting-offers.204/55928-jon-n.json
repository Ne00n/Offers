Since our launch in October 2012, our company strives to achieve what seems to be the impossible. We continuously strive to ascend to the top of the industry, providing hosting services at a level of quality and customer service that no other company can claim. Our company is made up of a unique team of individuals, well-determined and actively involved in the web hosting industy with years of experience with a passion for this industry. GreenValueHost is unlike any other hosting company out there. Host with us today; we'll welcome you to our family and you'll experience a difference - The GVH Difference.<br>\n<br>\n<b>1) We're a proudly registered All-American company.</b><br>\n<br>\nGreenValueHost is officially registered in the state of Illinois as a corporation under the name Green Value Hosting Inc. We are a legitimate business that has invested thousands of dollars to attain our growth. You can rest assured that we're not a fly-by-night company. We won't leave you high &amp; dry and we'll always be right here where you need us.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Click here to view our Business Registration Information in the Illinois Corporation/LLC Database </a> (Search Green Value Hosting Inc)<br>\n<br>\n<b>2) Working at GVH is our life and passion.</b><br>\n<br>\nWorking at GreenValueHost and working with hosting clients is our life and passion. It's what we love to do. We would like nothing more to do for a job than to be running and operating this company. Everyday is a new day that we wake up determined as we are every other day to work hard and be the best that we can be.<br>\n<br>\n<b>3) Our clients mean the WORLD to us!</b><br>\n<br>\nWithout a doubt we can proudly say that GreenValueHost is a customer-centric company. Without our clients, we wouldn't exist. This entire company revolves around our clients. We would bend over backwards and jump through flaming hoops to satisfy you, and we aren't kidding. Going the extra mile is what other companies will try to avoid doing, however we don't cut corners to make things work. We know our priorities and our clients come first before anything else.<br>\n<br>\n<b>4) Our servers are NOT overloaded and never will be!</b><br>\n<br>\nUnlike other hosts who try to stuff thousands of clients into one already overloaded server, we don't believe in taking profit over performance. We lightly load our servers and on top of that, we only deploy top of the line servers with RAID-10 Protection and LiteSpeed Web Server to ensure stability and speed. We make sure that your websites will always have plenty of breathing room in our server, meaning that the days of slow page loads are over.<br>\n<br>\n<b>5) We follow a strict Code of Ethics to deliver the best quality to our customers</b><br>\n<br>\nOur customers deserve more than just the industry standard, and that's something that we truly believe. We follow a well laid-out Code of Ethics written by our management team to ensure that the service you receive is always at it's best while at GreenValueHost.<a href=\"http://www.greenvaluehost.com/codeofethics.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Click here to view our Code of Ethics!</a><br>\n<br>\n<b>6) Our pricing structure is both reasonable AND profitable!</b><br>\n<br>\nUnlike other companies that attempt to underprice their hosting services until they collaspe or disappear, our services are sold at profitable prices that bring long-time success. 5000TB for $1/month? No thanks. Not at GVH.<br>\n<br>\n<b>7) We offer 24/7 Technical Support with a 10-Minute Average Response Time!</b><br>\n<br>\nHate having to wait hours and hours for a technical support query? No problem! We got you covered.
