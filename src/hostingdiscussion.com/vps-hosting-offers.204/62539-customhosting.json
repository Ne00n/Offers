You can choose your Memory/HDD/Bandwidth and IP allocations so that you can get what you need without paying for things you don't. <br>\n<br>\nFor example if you want to hold some backups of your files and just need a lot of HDD space but 2gb of memory is total overkill, then you could build a VPS with 256mb memory, 300gb HDD and whatever bandwidth you need. Alternatively if you have a small website that gets a lot of traffic, and just need a few gb HDD but a lot of bandwidth you could tailor your VPS this way as well. The combinations are endless, and for the first time, totally up to you!<br>\n<br>\nIf this wasn't enough, we'll also give you a great 20% lifetime discount or 50% off the first month to sweeten the deal. Just remember to use one of the following codes at signup:<br>\n<br>\n<b>CUSTOMLIFE20</b> - 20% permanent discount for the life of your product<br>\n<b>CUSTOMFIRST50</b> - 50% discount for the first month<br>\n<br>\nWe have also now enabled our plans to be paid for either monthly, quarterly or annually. Paying quarterly gives you a 10% discount, paying annually gives you the equivalent to 2 months free!
