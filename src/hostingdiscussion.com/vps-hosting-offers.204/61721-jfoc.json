No one else will have access to your server and you can be positive that you are secure.<br>\n- You want to be sure that you will get the resources purchased<br>\n- You will need anything of the above mentioned in the near future<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Compare to other types of hosting<br>\n---------------------------------------<br>\n</b><b>VPS vs. Virtual Hosting</b><br>\n<b>VPS advantages :</b><br>\n* Complete access to the system, root-user privileges.<br>\n* No limits on WWW domains, data bases, domain zones, ssh / ftp / email users. VPS has system resources limitations only.<br>\n* With a virtual private server, you can run your own custom firewall. This will enable you to enforce your own control policy that will only allow people you want to be able to access it. All the other hosting provider customers (using many resources) will not affect your VPS.<br>\n* You can install the software and applications that you need and want to use on a VPS. This lessens your dependency on web hosts and bypasses the time delays and expenses accrued from them.<br>\n<br>\n<b>VPS disadvantage :</b><br>\n* It may seem too expensive to host your websites on a dedicated server, but when you compare it to shared hosting, the end result is worth it. Moreover, we are ready to offer you really low prices.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>VPS vs. Dedicated Server</b><br>\n<b>VPS advantages :</b><br>\n* Dedicated server is much more expensive then VPS.<br>\n* Our experts will install all the software for you. This will secure your VPS from infiltration and the use of the old software versions untrustworthy parts. With dedicated server, you will have to do it by yourself. Are you sure you can to it in time and in proper way?<br>\n<br>\n<b>VPS disadvantage :</b><br>\n* Dedicated server has more resources than VPS<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Payment: </b>PayPal<br>\n<b>Order: </b>sales@jfoc.net<br>\n<br>\n<b>Web Site : </b>www.jfoc.net<br>\n<br>\n:thumbup::twocents:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBest Regards,<br>\nJFOC Network Solution</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
