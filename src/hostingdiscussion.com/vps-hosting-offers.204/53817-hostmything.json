Try the HMT difference, and see how we can work for you!<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our approach to Open-VZ VPS</b><br>\nMany people believe Open-VZ based servers is just another way for incompetent web hosts to oversell their servers. Not at HMT. Here's our approach. Each VPS plan's guaranteed memory is counted towards our no-overselling guarantee. We never sell over 80% of our guaranteed memory to clients. The Burstable RAM is a bit different. We have implemented this so that if there is a surplus of resources on the node, a single client may utilize a burst (hence burstable) of RAM. This allows for us to provide Virtual Private servers that are both reliable and lightning fast. In addition to RAM, we never sell over 80% of our servers' total disk space, although realistically it is never over 50% sold because of the amount of storage capacity we have in each node<br>\n<br>\n<b>All VPS plans come with:</b><br>\n<ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Virtualizor VPS Control Panel</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Rock SolidRAID 10 Protected Disk Space</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Intel Xeon Quad Core Servers</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">No-Overselling Guarantee.
