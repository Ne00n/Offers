Are you a reseller?<br>\nA. No. We own all of our own servers. We have them located at 2 different data centers: Virtbiz in Dallas, and Tulix in Atlanta.<br>\n<br>\nQ. Do you offer a Money Back Guarantee?<br>\nA. Yes! 30 days... It's not \"no questions asked\" though, we'd like to know why you're leaving, but it has nothing to do with whether you get money back, we'd just like to know why so we can improve.<br>\n<br>\nQ. What control panels are available?<br>\nA. Standard is HyperVM and LXAdmin. DirectAdmin and CPanel are available as an extra cost option - $7.50 and $15 respectively.<br>\n<br>\nQ. Where are your servers / Who are your bandwidth providers?<br>\nA. Tulix in Atlanta providing Telia, Level3 and Cogent    Virtbiz in Dallas provides Level 3, AboveNet, Global Crossing, Cogent <br>\n<br>\nQ. Are your servers oversold/overloaded?<br>\nA. Absolutely not! We don't oversell, and typical server load is VERY light. As I write this the load averages on the customer facing servers, are running from 0.03 to 0.68 with an average of 0.31! <br>\n<br>\nQ. Do you monitor your servers or our VPS'es?<br>\nA. Yes! The nodes are remotely monitored by 2 external services. We will also be happy to add your VPS into the mix (up to 5 monitors).<br>\n<br>\nQ: Do you allow proxy sites, IRC, warez or other copyrighted and/or illegal material?<br>\nA: No. VPSes found to be running any of the above will be disabled without warning.<br>\n<br>\nQ: Do you make backups of all VPSs?<br>\nA: Yes! <br>\n  1) Daily with 7 days of off-site backups available via the HyperVM control panel.<br>\n  2) Nightly vzdump (requires a short downtime - usually &lt; 5 minutes for best protection) on the same server.<br>\n  3) Weekly copy of the vzdump to a NAS unit in the office in New Orleans.<br>\n  4) We can mail you a CD/DVD based copy of the vzdump to you. Free annually, $5 plus shipping afterwards.<br>\n  But we still suggest that you make and keep a backup yourself as well.<br>\n<br>\nQ. Do you have a price protection policy?<br>\nA. Unlike many hosts, we do. If you see a special we're offering, you can get that special just by asking for it, up to 1 change per year.<br>\n<br>\nNote: These Q&amp;A are for VPS accounts. Reseller account answers may vary, for example for resellers accounts, <br>\nwe use DirectAdmin only.</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
