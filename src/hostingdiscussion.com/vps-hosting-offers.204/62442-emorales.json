Your Business is Up and Running with ServInt LA and DC, now with Money Back Guarantee:</i></b><br>\n<br>\nThere are times in every company\u2019s history when it has to take a big, bold step in its quest to grow. ServInt was blazing trails in 1995 and we haven\u2019t stopped innovating since. In that same spirit, we\u2019d like to announce the latest evolution of ServInt.<br>\n<br>\nIntroducing ServInt LA.<br>\n<br>\nToday, ServInt is offering our most popular discount, 50% off of your first month with the use of the promo code <span style=\"color: blue\">HD2010VPS</span> at ServInt LA, our latest data center, and ServInt DC our existing network of data centers.<br>\n<br>\nServInt LA is comprised of three major initiatives:<br>\n<br>\n1. Building a heavy duty data center presence on the West Coast of the United States, and empowering customers to buy hosting services in either location.<br>\n<br>\n2. Building a powerful cross-country network that makes traffic faster for all ServInt customers by allowing all of our data centers to take advantage of each others\u2019 connectivity.<br>\n<br>\n3. Increasing the quality of ServInt\u2019s network connectivity to Mexico, Latin America, and Asia.<br>\n<br>\nWe can proudly say we have done all three.<br>\n<br>\nThis is the same ServInt you know and love, just on the West Coast. We have on-site support technicians at ServInt LA, just as they are in DC. Though our Managed Services Team will continue to operate out of our mothership on the East Coast, we are building out ServInt LA to run according to the same high set of standards that have turned ServInt DC into such a success.<br>\n<br>\nWith this promo only, ServInt is also offering new customers a limited money-back guarantee. We believe we have the best VPS in the business, and we generally let our reputation speak for itself. However, should a migration not go as planned, or should you feel overwhelmed by the customizability of a ServInt VPS, we want to minimize the risk to you. So if you use this code and your site is within our <a href=\"http://www.ServInt.net/policies.php\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Acceptable Use Policies</a> and you are having problems or are dissatisfied within your first 30 days of service, ServInt will give you your money back. Plain and simple.<br>\n<br>\nServInt's VPS is a powerful combination of CentOS Linux, Parallels Virtuozzo, and more than 50,000 lines of continually optimized code. A ServInt VPS is fast, powerful, and expertly managed.<br>\n<br>\nServInt has a committment to upgrade its hardware and software as technology progresses. Earlier this year we extensively upgraded the entire ServInt VPS line. We doubled RAM, raised and in most cases doubled storage, and increased bandwidth on each of our VPS packages at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.<br>\n<br>\nYou're <i>never</i> left behind with ServInt.<br>\n<br>\nEvery VPS product is a true Enterprise-class DSR - a Dedicated Server Replacement - brought to you exclusively by ServInt.<br>\n<br>\n<b><a href=\"http://www.servint.net/landing.php?p=hd&amp;t=2/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Our Solutions:</a></b><br>\n<br>\nHere are just two examples:<br>\n<br>\n<b><a href=\"http://www.servint.net/landing.php?p=hd&amp;t=2/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"><span style=\"color: blue\">Essential VPS</span></a></b><br>\n30 GB Disk Space (RAID 10 on 15k rpm SAS drives)<br>\n1 TB Monthly Transfer<br>\n768 MB Guaranteed (1.5 GB Burst RAM)<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.servint.net/landing.php?p=hd&amp;t=2/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">$49 Monthly after the first month</a><br>\n<br>\n<b><a href=\"http://www.servint.net/landing.php?p=hd&amp;t=2/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SuperVPS</span></a></b><br>\n75 GB Disk Space (RAID 10 on 15k rpm SAS drives)<br>\n3 TB Monthly Transfer<br>\n4 GB Guaranteed (8 GB Burst RAM)<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.servint.net/landing.php?p=hd&amp;t=2/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">$199 Monthly after the first month</a><br>\n<br>\nA ServInt VPS is fast, ingeniously and securely managed, and backed by a reputation we strive tirelessly to maintain.
