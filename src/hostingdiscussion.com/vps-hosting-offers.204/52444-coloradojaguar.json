We have been in this industry since 1998 and know we owe that all to our loyal clients. We put the client first in everything we do from tightly controlled and monitored machines to overall network performance. We have owned our own hardware, networking equipment, and supermicro servers for 13 years now. Our staff is mostly US based with new headquarters in Colorado Springs, and hey we're always hiring! Give us a call 24/7/365, live chat, email or drop by our community forums.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFAQ:<br>\nWhat does your initial install and managed support cover?<br>\nA detailed list can be found on our managed services page.<br>\nWe will :<br>\n- provide the initial setup and secure services<br>\n- provide upgrades to your OS including security patches<br>\n- provide free remote hands for troubleshooting<br>\n- provide free hardware replacement<br>\n- provide a customized firewall<br>\n- just about anything you need done server wide<br>\n<br>\n*How do I get my second month free for two months free total?<br>\nJust order from the links above, our system will automatically do the rest.<br>\n<br>\nDo you allow adult content?<br>\nYES, we allow legal adult content<br>\n<br>\nDo you allow IRC or Proxy sites?<br>\nNo, sorry we do not. <br>\n<br>\nHow long does it take to setup my VPS?<br>\nIt can vary from a few minutes to few hours due to the varying levels of verification every order goes through. If you wish to find out about your order status we welcome you to call us at any time. <br>\n<br>\nWhat is a lifetime discount?<br>\nWe invented it! Just search the forums for the first time the term was used here. Its when the discount stays with your account as long as you keep it. The discount can even be passed on to higher vps plans if you decide to upgrade later.<br>\n<br>\nWhat locations are available?<br>\nWe operate in Atlanta, Dallas, &amp; L.A. However Atlanta is our main location and the other smaller footprints can sell out much faster. We are happy to accommodate any location but do not advertise them as available, they may not be without delays for new equipment. Depending on demand we tend to stock various areas faster than others. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTEST FILE: <a href=\"http://www.jaguarpc.com/test.bin\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">http://www.jaguarpc.com/test.bin</a><br>\nMore Info: <a href=\"http://www.jaguarpc.com/vps-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">http://www.jaguarpc.com/vps-hosting/</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you have anymore questions call toll free 888-338-5261, visit our live chat, contact <a href=\"mailto:sales@jaguarpc.com\">sales@jaguarpc.com</a>, drop by our community forums.<br>\n<br>\n* Base package only, add ons not included.
