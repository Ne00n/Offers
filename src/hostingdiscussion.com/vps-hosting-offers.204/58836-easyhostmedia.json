With our managed Virtual Servers we take a complete server and partition it off into separate sectors.<br>\n<br>\nThe main advantage of a VPS over a shared hosting account is that your server is not effected by any other account on the server as you would be a shared hosting account. If someone on a different VPS is using too much of the resources (CPU or RAM), it only effects that node, and not yours.<br>\n<br>\nWith our inexpensive virtual servers you get full root access (SSH) to your server, and you have complete control over it. You are free to install any software you like, as long as it is allowed by our TOS. You can get a fully managed virtual private server, or, you can have an unmanaged virtual private server, the choice is yours!<br>\n<br>\nVPS Housed on servers with:<br>\nDual Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5410<br>\n12GB DDR2-667 ECC FB-DIMM RAM<br>\n2x 1TB SATA Drives (RAID 1)<br>\n100Mbit Dedicated Port<br>\nLocated in Albany, NY and New York City<br>\nAlbany Test File: <a href=\"http://173.233.80.101/100mb.test\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">http://173.233.80.101/100mb.test</a><br>\nNew York City Test File: <a href=\"http://204.145.80.237/test100.bin\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">http://204.145.80.237/test100.bin</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n <br>\nPlan Plans\t  \t <br>\n  \t                                         Starter \t       <br>\nDisk Space \t                        10GB \t        <br>\nBandwidth \t                        250GB \t        <br>\nMemory (RAM) \t                        256MB \t        <br>\nBurstable Memory (RAM) \t        512MB \t       <br>\nIP Addresses (IPv4) \t        1 \t               <br>\nManaged \t                               \u00a310 \t               <br>\nOur Price                                \u00a36/month \t    <br>\n  \t                                     <a href=\"https://niceday-hosting.co.uk/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=467\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">order now</a> <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n  \t                                         \t       Basic<br>\nDisk Space \t                       \t               25GB<br>\nBandwidth \t                         \t       500GB<br>\nMemory (RAM) \t                       \t               512MB<br>\nBurstable Memory (RAM) \t         \t       1GB<br>\nIP Addresses (IPv4) \t        \t       1<br>\nManaged \t                               \t               Yes<br>\nOur Price                                \t       \u00a316/month<br>\n\t     <a href=\"https://niceday-hosting.co.uk/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=468\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">order now</a><br>\n<br>\nWe run a Pro Rata system<br>\n<br>\nPrices shown on this page does not include VAT unless stated otherwise.
