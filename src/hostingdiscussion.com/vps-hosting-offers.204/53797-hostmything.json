Here is our latest client testimonial (Ordered both Web hosting and a VMP-5 VPS): </b><br>\n<i>\"HostMyThing is undoubtedly one of the best hosting I have ever used. The good thing about this hosting was that it has a convenient user interface and Cpanel/Virtulizor Hosting Panel. I am enjoying using services of HostMyThing.com. There is nothing to worry about. Storage, memory or speed, as it is all there. You can upgrade anytime and it\u2019s stable and reliable. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a better hosting with maximum uptime.<br>\nThe VPS and Shared Hosting were superb and stable. Also, the Live help or Support Tickets are really quick and helpful. You get help and support related to your questions in no time at all. There is a friendly environment over there. Furthermore, I have never come into attack using Hosting services of HMT. They have better protection against DDos and other attacks. I felt safe using HMT services. I have been using several Hosting services from other companies but I never had any complications using services of HMT or any down time. It\u2019s fast and secure. Also, you can install hundred of scripts in just single click. I really loved using HMT services.\"</i><br>\n-Another Satisfied Customer of HostMyThing <img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile    :)\" loading=\"lazy\" data-shortname=\":)\"><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Rock Solid Infrastructure</b><br>\nOur VPS nodes are located in a brand new Buffalo, New York datacenter built in 2009 by ColoCrossing. ColoCrossing is a well-established company operating since 2003 that has been dedicated to providing quality dedicated &amp; colocation services.

We guarantee our services will be reliable, and there when you need it. We back all of our hosting with a 30 day money-back guarantee. What sets HostMyThing apart from other hosts is our service \u2013 that\u2019s the HMT Difference. We always put our clients first, no matter what the case. Our company is made up of a talented team of individuals who all love what they do, with years of experience under their belts. HostMyThing is unlike any other hosting provider out there. Period. Try the HMT difference, and see how we can work for you!<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our approach to Open-VZ VPS</b><br>\nMany people believe Open-VZ based servers is just another way for incompetent web hosts to oversell their servers. Not at HMT. Here's our approach. Each VPS plan's guaranteed memory is counted towards our no-overselling guarantee. We never sell over 80% of our guaranteed memory to clients. The Burstable RAM is a bit different. We have implemented this so that if there is a surplus of resources on the node, a single client may utilize a burst (hence burstable) of RAM. This allows for us to provide Virtual Private servers that are both reliable and lightning fast. In addition to RAM, we never sell over 80% of our servers' total disk space, although realistically it is never over 50% sold because of the amount of storage capacity we have in each node.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>All VPS plans come with:</b><br>\n<ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Virtualizor VPS Control Panel</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Rock Solid RAID 10 Protected Disk Space</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Super Fast Intel Servers. </li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">No-Overselling Guarantee.
