Very simple - you sign up at <a href=\"https://turnkeyinternet.net/special-offers/cloud-reseller/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">https://www.turnkeyinternet.net/cloud-reseller</a>, you will have at least 150 GB of disk space, 15 GB ram, and 15+ ip's to start with.  You can provision as many cloud servers and virtual private servers as you like within that total block of resources.  You can purchase additional resources at any time, such as additional memory, or disk space. You will have fully automated access to provision your cloud based servers including reboot, re-image, delete, and even trouble shoot your cloud servers using the remote KVM over IP feature.  This is all done via our white label web control panel.  You market to and sign up your clients like you do today - with any price or server plan you like.  You login via the web control panel and provision the server for your client, and give them a username and password, plus the link to the white label control panel so they can then manage their own cloud server.  They never have to ask you for anything - they will have access to reboot, re-image or trouble shoot their own cloud server(s) via the remote KVM over IP tools.  That's it - you own the client, your client pays you directly, and you have complete control over the client. Everything is fully automated for you, but if you ever need a hand with anything you can contact our fast and friendly support team 24 hours a day via telephone, email or the help desk.  We will even help you trouble shoot any issues provisioning your cloud servers.  We even offer you access to purchase popular software licensing direct from us such as cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin, as well as numerous Microsoft Windows licensing options.  You can then resell those licenses or bundle them with your cloud server plans directly to your client.  <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease see <a href=\"https://turnkeyinternet.net/special-offers/cloud-reseller/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"><b>https://turnkeyinternet.net/special-offers/cloud-reseller/</b></a> for all details on our all new cloud reseller platform.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe offer 2 cloud-server reseller packages to start with (you can always add on more disk, memory, or cpu cores at any time as well to whichver plan you pick, or upgrade from one to the other at any time!).
