The cloud is hosted on 3tera\u2019s AppLogic operating system (www.3tera.com) filled with many features that your business needs. <br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: Blue\">Why on a cloud?</span></b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Additional Layer of Reliability and Redundancy</b> with the real time mirroring across multiple servers, which allows the system to reboot the applications onto another server in case of any hardware failure. This is automatically detected and rebooted within minutes and with zero data loss. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Virtual Appliances </b>allow you to finally get the proper infrastructure without the highly depreciating value of hardware. The grid allows us to assemble switches, firewalls and load balancers virtually without the initial cost and take it apart just as fast. This allows you to test out your infrastructure and modify it until you reach your optimal performance levels. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Virtual LAMP Clusters</b> are available at competitive rates compared to the competition and are also valid in this promotion. Whether you\u2019re looking for multiple database servers, mail servers, file servers or just plain web servers, this would be the ideal redundant solution for you. Of course, this is all hosted in an already redundant environment, which gives you the highest availability offered out there! <br>\n<br>\n<b>Scalability</b> is provided on-the-fly with a simple reboot! Don\u2019t go out there purchasing big servers in preparation of future needs when you can pay for only what you need now and increase it in the future. You can add or subtract bandwidth usage, RAM, CPU and HD space. You can start with a fraction of a CPU and under a GB of ram and scale it all the way to 8 CPUs with 8 GB of RAM. Save your money and invest it back in some revenue generating activities. <br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: Blue\">What kind of hardware is the cloud comprised of?</span></b><br>\n<br>\nThe cloud currently operates on Dell hardware with the <br>\n<b>minimum</b> configuration of: <br>\n<br>\n\u2022\tDual Intel Xeon 5410 Quad core CPUs (12 MB Cache per CPU) <br>\n\u2022\tMinimum of 8 GB DDR2 ECC RAM <br>\n\u2022\tMultiple hot swappable SATA-II Hard drives. <br>\n\u2022\t100 Mbps port <br>\n<br>\n<b> <span style=\"color: Red\"> Please Note: </span></b> None of the nodes are overloaded as AppLogic does not allow you to oversell your resources. You can view more details about the system here: <a href=\"http://www.rightservers.com/the-grid.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">http://www.rightservers.com/the-grid.html</a> <br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: Blue\">Where is the cloud located?</span></b><br>\n<br>\nThe cloud is located in Dallas, TX at Colo4dallas facility. It is hosted on the premium bandwidth mix consisting of four tier 1 providers - Level(3), Time Warner, AboveNet and Internap. <br>\n<br>\nThe network offers the redundancy of BGP enhanced by Internap's 5200 flow control platform (FCP).
