It is an ideal solution for an expanding hosting company, at a fraction of a dedicated server's cost.<br>\n<br>\nOur VMS machines are based on powerful Dual Xeon 2.0 Ghz processors and 2GB RAM. You are assigned minimum guaranteed resources. CPU/RAM means that this is the minimum CPU/RAM resources you can use; when you need them, nobody else can use them but you and your clients. If more resources are idle, you may use more than your allocation, up to the full 4Ghz total (dual 2Ghz). <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Included FREE: CPanel ($99 value!) </b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCPU Xeon 1.0 Ghz<br>\nDisk 8 GB<br>\nMemory : 512 MB<br>\nTransfer 150 GB<br>\nMonthly US$99<br>\nAvailable : 12<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.amplescope.com/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=100\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">[order]</a> <br>\n <br>\n<b><span style=\"color: RED\">Urgent Setup | 3-Month Billing | Web Host Manager</span></b>  <br>\n<br>\nFor any pre-sales questions, please contact a representative at <a href=\"mailto:sales@amplescope.com\">sales@amplescope.com</a> <br>\n<br>\nWe accept International Credit Card Payments via ccavenue and paypal too. <br>\n<br>\nRemember, this wonderful offer will expire within seven-days.
