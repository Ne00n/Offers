Starting around the beginning of 2009 we started to receive lots of emails and PMs asking if we had similar specials planned for 2009, and now the time is finally here! This year we have planned to make even more servers available to help even more folks to take advantage of these offers in the current economic climate!<br>\n<br>\nUp first: <b>2009 Hybrid Super Special!</b><br>\nWhat better way to introduce our recently revamped Hybrid server plans than a Super Special? <b>Our new Hybrid servers now come with Full Nightly Backups Included, 2000GB Premium transfer, and a new shiny (lower) pricetag of $99!</b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nGet <b><span style=\"color: RoyalBlue\">512MB RAM FREE + 20GB RAID-10 Disk Space FREE on our Hybrid Server!</span></b> for the lifetime of the account! <i> A $45/month Savings (over 30%!) on our new pricing! </i> Enter in the coupon code \"HYBRIDSUPER2009\" in the coupon section of our order form and this will be applied!<br>\n<br>\n<b>Special: 1 of 3</b><br>\n<b>Duration: 3 Weeks</b><br>\n<i>** This special will only be available until March 16, 2009 or until all available servers have been sold!
