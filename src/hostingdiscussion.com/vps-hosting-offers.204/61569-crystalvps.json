To celebrate we're giving everyone extra bandwidth. All servers are hosted in UK datacentres and each server has at least 100Mbps of Internet connectivity. All services are hosted on our parent company's (No Wires) UK network.<br>\n<br>\nWhat's Included:<br>\n<br>\nFree hosting control panel (LxAdmin)<br>\nFree reboots<br>\nFree reinstalls<br>\n2 IP Addresses<br>\nVPS Control panel<br>\n<br>\nWe utilise LXAdmin which gives you a basic web hosting control panel, ideal for small webhosts or for a personal site. This is included free with every VPS, however it is up to you if you use it. Every VPS comes with a VPS control panel which allows you to reinstall, and reboot the VPS as well as other various tasks. As such, you'll never need to wait to reboot a VPS as you can do it. You also get shell access directly from the host in case you break SSH.<br>\n<br>\nWe have the following extras:<br>\n<br>\nDirect Admin: \u00a35/Month<br>\ncPanel: \u00a310/Month<br>\n<br>\nTo order, select one of the plans from below (bigger plans can easily be catered for)<br>\n<br>\nPlan 1 - \u00a35<br>\n<br>\n128MB Ram<br>\n10GB Disk<br>\n100Gb Bandwidth (150Gb with offer)<br>\n\u00a35/month<br>\n<br>\nPlan 2 - \u00a310<br>\n<br>\n256MB Ram<br>\n20GB Disk<br>\n200GB Bandwidth (300Gb with offer)<br>\n\u00a310/Month<br>\n<br>\nPlan 3<br>\n<br>\n384MB RAM<br>\n25GB Disk<br>\n400Gb Bandwidth (600Gb with offer)<br>\n\u00a312/month<br>\n<br>\nPlan 4<br>\n<br>\n512MB RAM<br>\n30GB Disk<br>\n800GB Bandwidth (1000Gb with offer)<br>\n\u00a318.00/month<br>\n<br>\nPlan 5<br>\n<br>\n768MB RAM<br>\n35GB Disk<br>\n1000GB Bandwidth (1200GB with offer)<br>\n\u00a328.00/Month<br>\n<br>\nPlan 6<br>\n<br>\n1024MB RAM<br>\n40Gb Disk<br>\n1200Gb Bandwidth (1400GB with offer)<br>\n\u00a328.00<br>\n\u00a334/Month<br>\n<br>\nAll servers can burst to 100mbps<br>\n<br>\nOnce you've chosen, simply email <a href=\"mailto:sales@easyvps.co.uk\">sales@easyvps.co.uk</a> with which plan you want, and any extras and we'll tell you how to proceed. Remember what you see is what you pay. The price includes any relevant taxes. We will also price match like for like VPS (We have the final say, we won't price match suicidal pricing after all we do have staff to pay)<br>\n<br>\nFor those of you that want some more details, I hope the following will help<br>\n<br>\nTest IP (to traceroute or ping) 193.33.179.2<br>\nMultihomed on AS39602<br>\nWe allow IRC, but only \u00a8casual\u00a8 we would prefer to be asked about any IRCD linking, and the use of a VPS for selling BNC accounts is strictly forbidden.<br>\nWe accept PayPal, and bank transfer. We only accept verified paypal payments.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the speed or ping time is slow, if you let us know we will try to fix it for you!<br>\n<br>\nThank you,<br>\n<br>\nEasyVPS.co.uk</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
