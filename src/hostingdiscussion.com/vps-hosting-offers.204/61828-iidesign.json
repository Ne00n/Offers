We are a fairly new hosting company and we are not afraid to admit that.  We have been in the hosting industry for many of years now.  Unlike the majority of other hosts we set a backup plan in place.  We have stand by servers waiting to be used as backups in case of any emergencies. Rest assured, choosing Competitive Host you're in the right hands!  As we have zero intentions of closing down shop and going out of business anytime soon!<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><i>Use coupon <span style=\"color: Red\"><b>25OFF</b></span> to receive 25% off your first month invoice</i><br>\n<br>\n<i>We offer 24/7 support, if you're ever in the need of some help just enter a support ticket.</i><br>\n<br>\n<i>1hour - 24hour Guaranteed Setup Time, but normally within 15mins.</i><br>\n<br>\n<i>We offer 99.9% Uptime to our clients using our VPS services.</i><br>\n<br>\n<i>If you're switching from another VPS provider you will without a doubt see a difference!</i><br>\n<br>\n<i> Guaranteed Price Match:  We will match anyones price and additional 5% off - <span style=\"font-size: 9px\">We expect to see a previous invoice</span></i><br>\n<br>\n<i>Everyone would be hosted on top of the line servers with top of the line services!</i><br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"font-size: 12px\">Some F.A.Q's ----</span></b><br>\n<br>\n<i><b>1.) </b> Do you have a test IP?  We sure do.. 74.63.222.212 and you may also test out our test file as well.  <a href=\"http://74.63.222.212/10mb.test\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">http://74.63.222.212/10mb.test</a></i><br>\n<br>\n<i><b>2.)</b>  Who is your datacenter?

We will offer you a 1 week (7 Day) money back guarantee! No questions asked.</i><br>\n<br>\n<i><b>5.)</b>  Would you provide me with a free Control Panel?  Of course, before sending you your client details we install a fresh Operating System onto your VPS with LxAdmin as the Control Panel!</i><br>\n<br>\n<i><b>6.)</b>  What about Cpanel/DirectAdmin/Plesk?

We have no problems with this what so ever, as long as it is legal!</i><br>\n<br>\n<i><b>8.) </b> May I host a warez site?  You may not, and we have many reasons why we don't allow this. Mainly because it's not fair to the people that want to have a legal web site that's running slow, because of your illegal activities. </i> <br>\n<br>\n<i><b>9.) </b> I just ordered, how long till I'm setup?  We normally try to have you setup 15mins after ordering, but this could take up to 24hours.
