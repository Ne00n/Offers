I decided to take their services. Yogesh and his assistants have been strong and supported me throughout my server migration and installed all my software to me that I need and all its free!<br>\nAlso, I had trouble with the migration from my old whmcs license to my new license of whmcs, breezehost have been there for me and did all the work for me and without asking for money!<br>\nHonestly, my experience with this supplier has been rewarding, technical support is just awesome, 24/24 and available on MSN. Always there and available to help us in case of trouble.<br>\nI recommend to everyone for your needs BreezeHost for VPS solution because so far I have not seen a company as good.</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
