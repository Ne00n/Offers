It was necessary for us to have <b>reliable and affordable</b> web hosting backed by good customer service. Our business depended on it. We tried many other well known hosting companies and they left us feeling dissatisfied. What were we to do? <br>\n<br>\nWe created HostMyBytes in 2014 to fill our own needs for excellent hosting services. Then we decided to share our vision, processes and high standards with the world. <br>\n<br>\nToday, HostMybytes is well over two years old.  We have thousands of customers from all over the world, who every day depend on our servers and our support team to keep their projects online.<br>\nWeb hosting is what HostMyBytes does, and we strive to do it consistently better than any other company.<br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: Red\">Managed VPS server plans :</span></b><br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: Navy\">TO GET SPECIAL PRICES PLEASE USE <span style=\"color: Red\">VPS20</span> CODE</span></b><br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: Red\">Some of attracting features: </span></b><br>\n100% Owned Hardware (We are not resellers)<br>\nMultiple location availability (Quebec, Canada, Phoenix, Arizona, Jacksonville, Florida)<br>\n99.9% Server Uptime Guarantee<br>\n20GBPS DDOS firewall protection <br>\nFeatured packed SolusVM control panel<br>\n24/7 Fully Managed by Experienced Inhouse Technicians<br>\nInstant VPS Activation after Payment<br>\n5 Minute Response Times (1 hour guarantee)<br>\nWeekly Backups<br>\nFree cPanel <br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: Navy\">mVPS 2048</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: Red\">RAM :</span> <b>2 GBDedicated RAM</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Hard Disk :</span> <b>45 GBSSD Space</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Bandwidth : </span><b>1500 GBBandwidth</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">CPU : </span><b>x2 CPU Priority</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">IP address :</span> <b>1 IPAddress</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Price :</span><span style=\"color: Navy\"><b> $29 per month</b></span> <b>After Discount</b> <b><span style=\"color: navy\">$23.2 per month</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">ORDER NOW :</span> <b><a href=\"https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=0\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=0</a></b><br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: navy\">mVPS 3072</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">RAM : </span><b>3 GBDedicated RAM</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Hard Disk : </span><b>65 GBSSD Space</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Bandwidth : </span><b>3000 GBBandwidth</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">CPU :</span> <b>x3 CPU Priority</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">IP address :</span><b>1 IPAddress</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Price : </span><b><span style=\"color: Navy\">$36 per month</span> After Discount <span style=\"color: navy\">$28.8 per month</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">ORDER NOW : </span><b><a href=\"https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=1</a></b><br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: navy\">mVPS 4096</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">RAM :</span> <b>4 GBDedicated RAM</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Hard Disk : </span><b>90 GBSSD Space</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Bandwidth :</span> <b>4000 GBBandwidth</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">CPU :</span> <b>x4 CPU Priority</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">IP address :</span><b>2 IPAddresses</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Price :</span> <b><span style=\"color: navy\">$42 per month</span> After Discount <span style=\"color: navy\">$33.6 per month</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">ORDER NOW :</span> <b><a href=\"https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=2\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=2</a></b><br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: navy\">mVPS 6144</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">RAM : </span><b>6 GBDedicated RAM</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Hard Disk : </span><b>180 GBSSD Space</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Bandwidth :</span> <b>5000 GBBandwidth</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: Red\">CPU : </span><b>x4 CPU Priority</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">IP address : </span><b>2 IPAddresses</b><br>\n<span style=\"color: red\">Price : </span><b><span style=\"color: Navy\">$55 per month</span> After Discount <span style=\"color: navy\">$44 per month</span></b><br>\n<span style=\"color: Red\">ORDER NOW :</span> <b><a href=\"https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=3\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">https://clients.hostmybytes.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=3</a></b><br>\n<br>\n<b><span style=\"color: navy\">Frequently asked questions : </span></b><br>\n<br>\n<b>What payment methods do you accept?</b><br>\nWe accept credit/debit cards (processed by PayPal) and PayPal instant transfers.
