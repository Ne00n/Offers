All orders are manually reviewed, however, and we reserve the right to request for additional verification on orders we deem to be risky to a certain degree. On these orders, we also reserve the right to suspend the provisioned VPS should the client not provide the requested verification until such a time as the verification is complete.<br>\n<br>\n<b>What payment methods do you accept?</b><br>\nAt the moment we accept Paypal. You can also pay via credit cards using Paypal. We intend on adding support for additional digital currencies/wallets and Bitcoin in the near future.<br>\n<br>\n<b>What kind of support do you provide?</b><br>\nYou should understand that the service you're purchasing from us is a self-managed service. These VPS servers are not managed by us; it is your responsibility to manage them and we make it convenient for you by including access to SolusVM for most common tasks (reboot, shutdown, OS reload, etc). As such, for the price we charge, we are only able to provide support on network and hardware related issues that impact the actual functioning of your VPS. Support requests other than that are currently not entertained. If you need help managing your VPS, we recommend signing up with a professional management company.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Do you provide a control panel for my VPS?</b><br>\nA control panel is not included in the discounted pricing. However, we can include a control panel along with managed service should you decide to purchase at the list prices (prices mentioned on the website). Contact us for further details.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Do you take backups of my VPS?</b><br>\nWe do not currently have an automated backup procedure. We advise all our clients to maintain regular backups. In the event of a data loss, we cannot be held responsible.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Do you have a list of operating systems I can install on my VPS?</b><br>\nAll virtual servers are deployed with a default installation of CentOS 5, 64-Bit. You can, however, choose from a wide variety of other operating systems from within the SolusVM management panel. If you would like to install an OS that is currently not available on our provided list, please contact us and we'll add it if possible.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Do you have an affiliate program?</b><br>\n<br>\nWe don't have a public affiliate offering, yet. However, we're doing private affiliate promotions if you want to refer people to StrongNode and make some money. The payout rate can be negotiated on a % or fixed amount basis, and we'll track your sales using exclusive coupons we give you access to. Contact us for further details if you're interested.<br>\n<br>\n<b>What am I allowed/not allowed to host on my VPS?</b><br>\nPlease refer to our legal documents below:<br>\n<a href=\"http://strongnode.net/privacy.php\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://strongnode.net/privacy.php</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://strongnode.net/tos.php\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://strongnode.net/tos.php</a><br>\n<br>\n<b>================================================<br>\n<br>\nGet in touch with us:<br>\n<br>\nSales: </b>sales (at) strongnode.net<br>\n<b>Support: </b>support (at) strongnode.net<br>\n<b>Legal/Abuse: </b>legal (at) strongnode.net<br>\n<b>Twitter: </b>@Strong_Node<br>\n<br>\n<b>Client Area:</b> <a href=\"https://billing.strongnode.net/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://billing.strongnode.net/</a><br>\n<br>\nYou may use the 'Contact Us' link in the client area in case you have pre-sales queries (or just email us on our sales email).<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
