We have some excess capacity left on our legacy VPS environment, that we'd like to offer an LET promotion on. Of course, when we say 'legacy' we're not referring to old hardware, just that our VPS platform will be replaced by our cloud infrastructure thus rendering it as 'legacy'. <img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile    :)\" data-shortname=\":)\"><br>\n<br>\nCurrent excess capacity is on nodes built-out as following:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Dual Xeon E5-2660 v2's</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">96GB RAM</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Hardware RAID10 w/BBU</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Enterprise SAS SSD Drives</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Multiple gigabit uplinks</li>\n</ul>Currently We are offering 20 of the following:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">2 CPU Cores</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">128Mb RAM</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">5GB SSD Disk</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">500GB Data transfer</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">1 IPv4 Address</li>\n</ul>$15/year with promotion code: 128Promo<br>\n<br>\nOrder link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bpsnode.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=19\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.bpsnode.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=19</a><br>\n<br>\nDatacenter is the Telx facility located in Miami, FL<br>\n<br>\nLooking glass is located at:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lg.bpsnode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://lg.bpsnode.com</a><br>\n<br>\nOnce all 20 have been ordered, that will be the end of this promotion.<br>\n<br>\nOur cloud infrastructure will be in the final stages of build-out in August, at which point, we will also offer all current VPS customers at the time, free migration to our new cloud if they would like to take advantage of it.
