Please don't miss it as we cannot guarantee it will come back. Some providers call their services \"unmanaged\" and then don't give you any support at all. We advertise \"basic\" management - this means that your services aren't fully managed, however we won't leave you in the dark. We will help you. We have more great deals to come, but this one won't last long so grab one before stock runs out. We were advised we could post another offer, so here it is...<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<b>Package 1:</b><br>\n<br>\n30GB Disk Space<br>\n350GB Bandwidth<br>\n1GB RAM<br>\n1.5GB Burstable<br>\n4 CPU Cores<br>\n1 IP Address<br>\nOpenVZ<br>\nColumbus, OH<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<a href=\"https://premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a>&nbsp;- $4/month<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\n<b>Package 2:</b><br>\n<br>\n30GB Disk Space<br>\n350GB Bandwidth<br>\n2GB RAM<br>\n2.5GB Burstable<br>\n4 CPU Cores<br>\n1 IP Address<br>\nOpenVZ<br>\nColumbus, OH<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<a href=\"https://premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=6\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a>&nbsp;- $6/month<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n<br>\n<b>Package 3:</b><br>\n<br>\n10GB Disk Space<br>\n350GB Bandwidth<br>\n128MB RAM<br>\n256MB Burstable<br>\n4 CPU Cores<br>\n1 IP Address<br>\nOpenVZ<br>\nColumbus, OH<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<a href=\"https://premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=13\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a>&nbsp;- $7.50 semi annually OR $15 annually<br>\n<br>\n--<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nTest IP available on request.
