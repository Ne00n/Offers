The download speed is 1Gbit shared so that everyone can enjoy fast updates, download the content that they want, etc.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>I/O Speed</b>: we know how important good write speeds are for everyone, so we have set a soft limit of around 60% of the real write speed per VPS. This means that each VPS is capable of writes up to 400MB/s, while the raw write speed of the node is around 660MB/s. Having this soft limit in place allows all of our customers to enjoy good I/O speeds all the time, without any unpredictable fluctuations in performance.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>CPU Cores vs. vCPUs</b>: we only count real cores for all of our VPS packages. We do not count HyperThreading as real or virtual cores. CPU isolation for Xen is really good, so instead we differentiate packages by CPU priority. This allows our customers to get the best CPU performance at all times.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>Additional IPv4 Addresses</b>: they cost $3/IP/mo. If you need more than four IPv4 addresses for your VPS server, please open a support ticket and ask for a subnet to be assigned to you. We can assign up to a /29 for a 4GB VPS and a /28 for an 8GB VPS. Given the fact that web servers and browsers support SNI now, proper justification needs to be provided if you wish to obtain a subnet from us. SSL/VPN/SPAM - HAM mail servers are not valid justifications. If you wish to run your own cPanel server and sell shared hosting we can make an exception and assign a bigger than /28 subnet.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>Additional Bandwidth</b>: you can purchase up to 10TB additional bandwidth per VPS at $3/TB/mo.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>Cpanel License</b>: we offer cPanel VPS licenses at $12/mo.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>What's Allowed</b>: pretty much anything that is legal. Run your gaming server, VPN, IRC, whatever you want as long as it does not break any laws. You want to run a Minecraft server? Go right ahead. You want to use your VPS for Bitcoin mining? Sure. It's pretty pointless these days, but if it's your thing then do it.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>What's not Allowed</b>: everything that is illegal is not allowed. For example the torrenting of copyrighted materials, streaming illegal adult content or sending out SPAM. If you're unsure about something please open a ticket and ask before proceeding. Thank you.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>Yearly Pricing</b>: If you are interested in yearly pricing please open a ticket during the first 7 days after your initial purchase so that we can convert your plan to a year plan and apply a healthy discount to it. This should allow customers time to test our packages before jumping on a yearly plan.</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><b>Additional Questions</b>: if you have additional questions please <a href=\"https://my.phoenixvps.com/submitticket.php?step=2&amp;deptid=3\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">open a pre-sales ticket by clicking here</a>.</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
