Defined Code Ltd is a small company based in the Midlands, United Kingdom. We own our hardware in the Netherlands and have personally visited and installed it in the datacenter we colocate at in Rotterdam, Netherlands (Netrouting). With the dedicated IPv4 plans we are using rented hardware at OVH in Strasbourg, France.<br>\n<br>\n<b>NL Datacenter information:</b>&nbsp;Netrouting is housed in an ex-HP building meaning it has top security. It's a carrier neutral datacenter in Rotterdam with over 11000 sqft of datacenter space, there is 240gbps+ of external network capacity.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Hardware:</b>&nbsp;We currently use HP hardware with the latest Intel Xeon E3 CPUs (v3). You should not expect the \"Mini\" VPSs to outperform a full SSD node, however we try our hardest to deliver a quality you will enjoy for the price. For our dedicated IPv4 VPSs we are using E3 CPUs and a&nbsp;<b>PURE RAID SSD</b>&nbsp;setup.<br>\n<br>\n<b>About our NAT IPv4 VPSs:</b>&nbsp;These \"Mini\" servers do not come with a dedicated IPv4 address, instead they share an IPv4 address and you are assigned 21 ports on it. 1 port for SSH and the rest for whatever you want (VPNs, web servers, you name it!). This means that when you host a website you will have to append a port to the end, these are randomly generated and you can view yours in your control panel.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Good news IPv6 support is now available. We can allocate you native IPv6 addresses as and when you need, just drop us a ticket after you've ordered.</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>September OpenVZ VPS offers:</b><b>&nbsp;</b><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote is-expandable\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent \">\nVZ 1024<br>\n<br>\nRAM: 1024MB<br>\nUnmanaged<br>\n6GB&nbsp;<b>PURE RAID SSD</b><br>\n10TB Transfer (in/out)<br>\n100mbit uplink<br>\n<b>1 IPv4 address</b><br>\nNative IPv6 on request (up to 20)<br>\nOpenVZ Virtualisation<br>\nStrasbourg, France<br>\nPrice: \u00a33.25/month<br>\nOrder:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=4</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink\"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>\n</div>\n</blockquote><b>September MINI VPS offers with coupon code INTROLEBT:&nbsp;</b><br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote is-expandable\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent \">\nMini 64<br>\n<br>\nRAM: 64MB<br>\nUnmanaged<br>\n3GB RAID HDD<br>\n50GB Transfer (in/out)<br>\n1GBIT uplink<br>\n20 IPv4 NAT Ports<br>\n1 IPv4 NAT SSH Port<br>\nNative IPv6 on request (up to 20)<br>\nOpenVZ Virtualisation<br>\nRotterdam, Netherlands<br>\nPrice: \u00a32/year with coupon code: INTROLEBT<br>\nOrder:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1</a><br>\n<br>\nMini 128<br>\n<br>\nRAM: 128MB<br>\nUnmanaged<br>\n3GB RAID HDD<br>\n50GB Transfer (in/out)<br>\n1GBIT uplink<br>\n20 IPv4 NAT Ports<br>\n1 IPv4 NAT SSH Port<br>\nNative IPv6 on request (up to 20)<br>\nOpenVZ Virtualisation<br>\nRotterdam, Netherlands<br>\nPrice: \u00a34/year with coupon code: INTROLEBT<br>\nOrder:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink\"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>\n</div>\n</blockquote><b>Payments:</b><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0)\">&nbsp;All payments are taken via Stripe.</span><br>\n<br>\n<b>Test IP:</b>&nbsp;94.228.216.114<br>\n<b>Test file:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://definedcodehosting.com/10mb.bin\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://definedcodehosting.com/10mb.bin</a><br>\n<br>\n<b>Simple AUP/TOS:</b>&nbsp;TOR, Torrents, Bitcoin (and associated altcoins (Litecoin etc)), Minecraft, Public Proxies and Public VPN software are all prohibited.
