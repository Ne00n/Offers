With our new on-site solar power system, we produce our own energy. The energy we use in excess of that comes from clean, renewable, hydro-electric power, sourced from Niagara Falls, New York, at a substantially reduced cost for power compared to traditional data centers. Our other green technology investments, such as Smart Aisle precision cooling and cold containment systems, provide an additional 33% efficiency over traditional data centers, further reducing our electricity utilization. This all adds up to entirely renewable electricity, and a zero carbon footprint, as evidenced by our EPA ENERGY STAR certification. Ultimately, this adds up to a lower cost of providing our reliable service.&nbsp; Lastly, we own and operate our own facility, servers, routers, and network connections.&nbsp; We are not resellers or wholesalers, so we do not have the higher operating costs of renting servers and equipment. This allows us to pass down the savings to our customers.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Where are the servers located?</b><br>\nThese specials are available in our ENERGY STAR certified, <a href=\"http://www.turnkeyinternet.net/green/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GREEN</a> data center, in New York\u2019s Tech Valley Region.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Do you have a money back guarantee?</b><br>\nYes.
