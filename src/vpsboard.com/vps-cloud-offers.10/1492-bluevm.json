If you have any issues please feel free to open a ticket with our staff we'd love to help you resolve these issues.<br>\n<br>\n<b>If you are an existing customer of BlueVM you may be asking: Why isn't my VPS on Feathur yet?</b><br>\n&lt;br&gt;We are preparing our nodes (literally right now) to be used with Feathur. This involves converting our nodes from CentOS 5 to CentOS 6 and migrating users from HyperVM to Feathur. It's a very involved process and we are taking the time to make sure that it is completed with little-to-no user downtime. We expect to begin moving users in Buffalo, NY to Feathur tomorrow and we should be completed before Monday. After that we will be migrating Atlanta, Illinois, Texas and California (in that order)...<br>\n<br>\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or comments...</div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
