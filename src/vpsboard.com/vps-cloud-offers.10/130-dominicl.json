Thanks to everybody who ordered.</i></b>\u200b</div><br>\nPremiumVM is back! We've extended this deal, so please don't miss it as we cannot guarantee it will come back. Some providers call their services \"unmanaged\" and then don't give you any support at all. We advertise \"basic\" management - this means that your services aren't fully managed, however we won't leave you in the dark. We will help you. We have more great deals to come, but this one won't last long so grab one before stock runs out.<br>\n<br>\n<i>As LET is down and today was the day we were going to post an offer, we'll post it on here instead!
