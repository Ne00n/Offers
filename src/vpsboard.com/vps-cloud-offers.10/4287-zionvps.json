We have been providing openvz and kvm offers since 2 months. The registration as a LLP is already under process and should take no more than one month. &nbsp;We specialize in providing affordable servers. We are dedicated to run the business, and prepared for financial liabilities in upcoming months. At first, we plan to rent dedicated servers, until all the legal obligations are cleared, then we will start co locating at different locations with our own hardware.<br>\n<br>\nOffer info: Today we are &nbsp;here to offer openvz servers. The nodes are located in Montreal, Canada. Node specs are AMD Operaton CPU, 32 or 64 GB ram, 4x2tb hard disks raided 0+1, bandwidth upgraded to 1.5Gbps. All the following plans are unmanaged, however management and cpanel are offered as an addon. Management is reactive, and done via skype. The node is hosted in OVH datacenter. We keep a strict watch on overselling and only allocate 90% of node resources to virtual private servers, no matter how much of resources is currently being consumed. Offshore backups are taken everyday on each node via FTP, and we will soon implement features allowing clients to backup their system on their own.<br>\n<br>\nPlans :&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">&nbsp;\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">Plan 1:<br>\n$06.50$ /Mo\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">30 GB Raid protected SAS HDD<br>\n512 mb ram<br>\nunmetered bandwidth*<br>\n1 IPv4, 2 IPv6 with DDoS protection\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">Access to 2 cpu cores<br>\n<a href=\"https://billing.zionvps.com/cart.php?gid=1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">buy now</a>\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\"><br>\nPlan 2:<br>\n$09.50$ /Mo\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">50 GB Raid protected SAS HDD<br>\n1024 mb ram<br>\nunmetered bandwidth*<br>\n1 IPv4, 3 IPv6 with DDoS protection\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">Access to 3 cpu cores<br>\n<a href=\"https://billing.zionvps.com/cart.php?gid=1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">buy now</a>\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\"><br>\nPlan 3:<br>\n$15.50$ /Mo\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">60 GB Raid protected SAS HDD<br>\n2048 mb ram<br>\nunmetered bandwidth*<br>\n1 IPv4, 3 IPv6 with DDoS protection\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">Access to 3 cpu cores<br>\n<a href=\"https://billing.zionvps.com/cart.php?gid=1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">buy now</a>\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\"><br>\nPlan 4:<br>\n$19.50$ /Mo\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">75 GB Raid protected SAS HDD<br>\n3072 mb ram<br>\nunmetered bandwidth*<br>\n1 IPv4, 3 IPv6 with DDoS protection\u200b</div><div style=\"text-align: center\">Access to 4 cpu cores<br>\n<a href=\"https://billing.zionvps.com/cart.php?gid=1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">buy now</a>\u200b</div><br>\n<br>\n* You may not use unmetered bandwidth for denial - of service attacks.
