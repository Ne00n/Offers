We started on the back of the trend providing low cost 2GB virtual machines, but instead of crowding users onto the nodes like the big boys, our aim was 0 overselling and guaranteed performance. This worked out great for a while, however to continue to offer such low prices we increased the overselling limit from 0% (not oversold), to 100% (resources oversold 2:1). We felt this was still extremely competitive, with many of the main players overselling 4:1 and even 8:1+ in some cases!<br>\n<br>\nWe grew quite fast with two main LEB offers and some support from referrals and WHT. We currently sponsor a few different gaming clans, from UT99 to Minecraft to GTA:SA, all whom have felt the benefit of such low oversold VMs especially the resource hog Minecraft! We might be a smaller provider, but we have a proven track record and a long-term commitment to our customers and business. There might be better deals out there, and better performance, but for the best of both worlds and a reliable provider, we think we're one of the better options!<br>\n<br>\nSo now on the eve of our 2nd anniversary we come back with another exciting offer, this time <b>4GB RAM for $8.4/mo</b> paid yearly, or <b>$11.25 monthly</b>. <b>No coupons required</b>, just <a href=\"https://billing.allyourvps.com/cart.php?gid=4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">click to order</a>, and be instantly provisioned!<br>\n<br>\nWe use:<br>\n<br>\nOVH France, Roubaix DCs.&nbsp;5.39.66.144&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ipv4.proof.ovh.net/files/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://ipv4.proof.ovh.net/files/</a><br>\n<br>\nHetzner Germany, Frankfurt DCs.&nbsp;5.9.123.201<br>\n<br>\nRedstation UK, Hampshire.&nbsp;31.3.244.226&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.as35662.net/speedtest.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.as35662.net/speedtest.html</a><br>\n<br>\nPrivatelayer CH, Zurich.&nbsp;46.19.136.226<br>\n<br>\nPsychz US, LosAngeles.&nbsp;198.13.123.195<br>\n<br>\n2nd anniversary VPS specs:<br>\n<br>\n- OpenVZ with SolusVM management<br>\n<br>\n- 4GB RAM guaranteed<br>\n<br>\n- 90GB HDD<br>\n<br>\n- 1TB BW@1GBPS<br>\n<br>\n- 2 vCPU<br>\n<br>\n- 1 IPv4<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://billing.allyourvps.com/cart.php?gid=4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">[Order links]</a><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nReasonable use allowed (IRC, Proxy, Adult), see TOS/AUP at 2gbvps.com/tos.html<br>\n<br>\nExtra IP from $1/mo/IP<br>\n<br>\nExtra BW from $2/TB<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nLEB offers and comments, mostly all positive!<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/2gbvps-com-7-2gb-openvz-in-france-germany-uk-dallas/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://lowendbox.com/blog/2gbvps-com-7-2gb-openvz-in-france-germany-uk-dallas/</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://lowendbox.com/blog/2gbvps-com-7-2gb-openvz-vps-in-ukfrdech-us/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://lowendbox.com/blog/2gbvps-com-7-2gb-openvz-vps-in-ukfrdech-us/</a></div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
