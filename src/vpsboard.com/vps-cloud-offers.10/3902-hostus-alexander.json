We are a privately held company with NO other investors. We treat each and every one of our clients with the utmost respect that they highly deserve. All plans are now semi-managed, this means we can troubleshoot issues for you such as but not limited to \u201cNetwork Issues, Load issues and I/O Issues\u201d Tasks excluded from our semi-management is task such as setting up your scripts, installing and configuring PHP etc.<br>\n<br>\nWe keep our nodes and networks protected from abuse and spammers. By default port 25 is blocked switch level; this can be removed by simply submitting a ticket. We don't allow spammers and abusers on our network, so if you plan to order a VM, SPAM and DDoS, then prepare to not get a refund, because of these practices, our node uptime is low end industry leading with super fast I/O usage and low CPU usage.<br>\n<br>\nTypical virtual private servers are costly and are&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: inherit\">oversold, which make them slow and unresponsive. HostUS powered OpenVZ servers ensure that there is no over-selling, and that performance is available 24/7 on demand by the customer. Handle very large amounts of data processing with extremely powerful dual processor server nodes, powered by RAID10 with a BBU disk configuration. All our nodes are connected with 2 x 1 Gbps ports (Bonded) and each VPS is limited to 900Mbit/s. We own and operate most our hardware such as our primary switch; Juniper EX3200-24T Switch with a 10 Gbps uplink.</span><br>\n<br>\n<b>Minimum Node Specifications</b><br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">OpenVZ Visualization</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Dual Xeon L5639 Processors</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">4x 2TB SATA II Drives</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">LSI Hardware RAID-10 w/ BBU Configuration</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">72GB DDR3 ECC RAM</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">2 x Gbps Public (Bonded) and 1 x Gbps Internal/Private</li>\n</ul><b>LET Exclusive Special-1</b>&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n4 vCPU Cores @ 2.2Ghz Fair Share<br>\n3 GB DDR3 RAM&nbsp;<br>\n3 GB SWAP&nbsp;<br>\n150 GB HW Raid-10 Disk Space<br>\n5000 GB Bandwidth, 700mbps Up-link<br>\n3 x IPv4 Addresses (With Automatic rDNS)&nbsp;<br>\n$7 /month<br>\n$18 /Quarter (*<b>Pay Quarterly and receive double RAM! 6GB RAM / 6GB vSWAP</b>)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOrder -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=64\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=64</a><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b>** LET Exclusive Special-2**&nbsp;</b><br>\n<br>\n4 vCPU Cores @ 2.2Ghz Fair Share<br>\n1 GB DDR3 RAM&nbsp;<br>\n1 GB SWAP&nbsp;<br>\n50 GB HW Raid-10 Disk Space<br>\n1000 GB Bandwidth, 700mbps Up-link<br>\n1 x IPv4 Addresses (With Automatic rDNS)&nbsp;<br>\n$4 /month<br>\n$10 /Quarter (*<b>Pay Quarterly and receive double RAM! 2GB RAM / 2GB vSWAP</b>)<br>\n<br>\nOrder -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=65\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=65</a><br>\n<br>\n<b>Upgrades&nbsp;</b><br>\n+ Additional IP Each: 50c per IP w/ IP Justification<br>\n+ 5 Usable IPs $4.00 /month<br>\n+ 13 Usable IPs $8.00 /month<br>\n+ 29 Usable IPs $15.00 /month<br>\n+ Unlimited Internal IP's $0.00 /month<br>\n+ cPanel VPS Licence $13/month<br>\n+ WHMCS Licence (Branded) $14/month<br>\n<br>\n<b>Network</b><br>\n<br>\nAll our servers are located in Atlanta, Georgia - 55.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nLooking glass:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://atl-lg.hostus.us/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://atl-lg.hostus.us/</a>&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIP SWIP Is available as well, please create a ticket after order with either your ORG-ID or the organisation name you would like.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nBest regards,<br>\nAlexander McNeil<br>\nHostUS Solutions LTD<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><a href=\"https://lowendtalk.com/vanilla/post/editdiscussion/24059\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Attach Poll</a><br>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
