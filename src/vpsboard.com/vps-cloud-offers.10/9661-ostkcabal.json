Our aging VPS hosting was starting to show its age, and with a lack of updates in regards to the new SolusVM panel, we've decided to release an all-new vps service. Our main focus was on value, with performance and features following very closely.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Virtualizor control panel has been the perfect addition to our vps hosting services. With more features than SolusVM could ever hope to have, and the ability to support easy-to-use one-click install applications, we've been very happy in our internal testing and look forward to hearing back from our customers with their opinions, suggestions, and ideas for making it even better!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs usual, our servers are proudly hosted in Chicago at the Steadfast Networks 725 S. Wells facility. We make use of Steadfast's incredible financial and healthcare-optimized network, prioritizing speed, low latency, and excellent routing. <b><a href=\"https://bgp.he.net/AS32748\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">More info</a></b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe VMs themselves run on Intel Xeon E3 or E5 machines running at a minimum of 3.3GHz, DDR3/DDR4 RAM, and RAID-10 SSD storage. VM machines are never oversold and always built to enterprise standards.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>===========================================</b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>2017 KVM VPS Line</b><br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">KVM Virtualization<br>\n</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Instant Deployment<br>\n</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Tons of OS Options<br>\n</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\"><a href=\"http://www.virtualizor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Virtualizor</a> Control Panel<br>\n</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">One-Click Install of LAMP, LEMP, or WordPress (more coming soon)<br>\n</li>\n</ul><br>\n<b><a href=\"https://ready2frag.com/vps\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"color: #FF8C00\">Info and Order!</span></a></b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>===========================================</b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWondering what you can and can't do on your VPS at Ready2Frag?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://ready2frag.com/legal/tos\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Terms of Service</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://ready2frag.com/legal/usage\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Acceptable Usage Policy</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://ready2frag.com/legal/sla\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Service Level Agreement</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe stand behind our VPS.
