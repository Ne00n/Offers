We are a privately held company with NO other investors. We treat each and every one of our clients with the utmost respect that they highly deserve. All plans are now semi-managed, this means we can troubleshoot issues for you such as but not limited to ; Network Issues, Load issues and I/O Issues; Tasks excluded from our semi-management is task such as setting up your scripts, installing and configuring PHP etc.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nWe keep our nodes and networks protected from abuse and spammers. By default port 25 is blocked switch level; this can be removed by simply submitting a ticket. We don't allow spammers and abusers on our network, so if you plan to order a VM, SPAM and DDoS, then prepare to not get a refund, because of these practices, our node uptime is low end industry leading with super fast I/O usage and low CPU usage.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nTypical virtual private servers are costly and are oversold, which make them slow and unresponsive. HostUS powered OpenVZ servers ensure that there is no over-selling, and that performance is available 24/7 on demand by the customer. Handle very large amounts of data processing with extremely powerful dual processor server nodes, powered by RAID10 with a BBU disk configuration. All our nodes are connected with 2 x 1 Gbps ports (Bonded) and each VPS is limited to 1000Mbit/s. We own and operate all our hardware such as our primary switch; Juniper EX3200-24T Switch with a 10 Gbps uplink.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nEvery OpenVZ Plan comes with 16 x native IPV6.
