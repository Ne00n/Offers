The backend is in active development and XVM Labs basically runs on nightly builds.<br>\n<br>\nWe try our best to minimize disruptions. In the meantime, if you need more reliable service, consider using <a href=\"http://bandwagonhost.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bandwagonhost.com</a> or <a href=\"http://vpsblast.net\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">vpsblast.net</a>.</div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
