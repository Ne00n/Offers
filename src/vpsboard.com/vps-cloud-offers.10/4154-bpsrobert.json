We offer all Pure SSD VPS's. No SSD Caching, No spinning disks. While the company itself, is fairly new (opened in 2013), bpsNode owners have been in the hosting industry for over a decade, offering other quality services such as VoIP, Hosted PBX's, Shared Hosting, Colo, and dedicated hosting under other brand names. We've combined those companies together into bpsNode, in an initiative to aggressively compete in the VPS Market while we build-out our CloudStack infrastructure to poise ourselves to offerr a full and rich range of hosting solutions, and move into the IaaS markets.<br>\n<br>\nDuring our CloudStack build-out, we've sectioned off a few new nodes to put into our current legacy VPS offerings and have that stock available again. This will be our last Legacy VPS offerings, while we build-out our cloud infrastructure. There is also a current promotion running for 10% off any legacy VPS package by using the promo code NEWSTOCK10.<br>\n<br>\nCurrent Pure SSD <b>OpenVZ</b> Plans available:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.bpsnode.com/billing/cart.php?gid=4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>OpenVZ Order Link</u></a><br>\n<br>\n<b>OVZ512</b> - $8.00/mo<br>\n<br>\n2 CPU Core Access<br>\n<br>\n40GB SSD RAID-10 HD<br>\n<br>\n512Mb Ram + 512Mb VSwap<br>\n<br>\n1Gbps Port<br>\n<br>\n1000GB Monthly Transfer<br>\n<br>\n1 IPv4 Address<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b>OVZ1GB&nbsp;</b>- $15.00/mo<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n4 CPU Core Access<br>\n<br>\n60GB SSD RAID-10 HD<br>\n<br>\n1GB Ram + 1GB VSwap<br>\n<br>\n1Gbps Port<br>\n<br>\n2000GB Monthly Transfer<br>\n<br>\n2 IPv4 Addresses<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nCurrent Pure SSD&nbsp;<b>KVM</b> Plans available:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.bpsnode.com/billing/cart.php?gid=5\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">KVM Order Link</a><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b>KVM512</b> - $12.00/mo<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n2 CPU Core Access<br>\n<br>\n10GB SSD RAID-10 HD<br>\n<br>\n512Mb Ram<br>\n<br>\n1Gbps Port<br>\n<br>\n1000GB Monthly Transfer<br>\n<br>\n1 IPv4 Address<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b>KVM1GB&nbsp;</b>- $25.00/mo<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n4 CPU Core Access<br>\n<br>\n20GB SSD RAID-10 HD<br>\n<br>\n1GB Ram<br>\n<br>\n1Gbps Port<br>\n<br>\n2000GB Monthly Transfer<br>\n<br>\n2 IPv4 Addresses<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
