We treat each and every one of our clients with the utmost respect that they highly deserve, and we treat and care for their websites as if it was our own site.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThe staff at HostUS are pleased to announce a new line of affordable unmanaged Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) based Virtual Private Servers(VPSs). One year ago, we made affordable high-quality web hosting possible, and now we enter one of the more popular web hosting solutions available today. A virtual private server is typically a slice of a dedicated server, allocated completely and solely to you! Dedicated resources and power help your website boom and help it handle larger levels of traffic, without any kind of interruption due to limited shared resources. Not only that, you will have full root access to your server at all times, which gives you complete control over your hosting.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nTypical virtual private servers are costly and are oversold, which make them slow and unresponsive. HostUS powered KVM servers ensure that there is no over-selling, and that performance is available 24/7 on demand by the customer. Handle very large amounts of data processing with extremely powerful dual processor server nodes, fully equipped with super-fast IO, powered by the RAID10 with BBU disk configuration.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nWe can upload any ISO/Template you want, simply submit a ticket! We don't allow windows OS on our servers.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0)\">KVM1 (512MB)</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?gid=22\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Order</a><br>\n<br>\n512MB Dedicated RAM<br>\n<br>\n20 GB Dedicated Disk Space<br>\n<br>\n200 GB Bandwidth (1 Gbit/s)<br>\n<br>\n1 Dedicated IPV4 Address<br>\n<br>\nIPV6 Coming Soon<br>\n<br>\n2 Cores @ 2.5GHz+<br>\n<br>\n$5.95/month | only $3.00/month using coupon&nbsp;<b>KVMVPS150</b><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0)\">KVM2 (1GB)</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?gid=22\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Order</a><br>\n<br>\n1024MB Dedicated RAM<br>\n<br>\n50 GB Dedicated Disk Space<br>\n<br>\n500 GB Bandwidth (1 Gbit/s)<br>\n<br>\n1 Dedicated IPV4 Address<br>\n<br>\nIPV6 Coming Soon<br>\n<br>\n2 Cores @ 2.5GHz+<br>\n<br>\n$10.95/month | only $5.50/month using coupon&nbsp;<b>KVMVPS250</b><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0)\">KVM3 (2GB)</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?gid=22\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Order</a><br>\n<br>\n2048MB Dedicated RAM<br>\n<br>\n75 GB Dedicated Disk Space<br>\n<br>\n750 GB Bandwidth (1 Gbit/s)<br>\n<br>\n1 Dedicated IPV4 Address<br>\n<br>\nIPV6 Coming Soon<br>\n<br>\n4 Cores @ 2.5GHz+<br>\n<br>\n$16.95/month | only $8.50/month using coupon&nbsp;<b>KVMVPS350</b><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0)\">KVM4 (4GB)</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?gid=22\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Order</a><br>\n<br>\n4096MB Dedicated RAM<br>\n<br>\n150 GB Dedicated Disk Space<br>\n<br>\n2 TB Bandwidth (1 Gbit/s)<br>\n<br>\n2 Dedicated IPV4 Address<br>\n<br>\nIPV6 Coming Soon<br>\n<br>\n6 Cores @ 2.5GHz+<br>\n<br>\n$28.95/month | only $14.50/month using coupon&nbsp;<b>KVMVPS350</b><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b>Extras</b><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIPV4 Address - $1<br>\n<br>\n128MB of RAM - $1<br>\n<br>\ncPanel VPS &nbsp; - $12<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our Network</b><br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nAll our servers are located in Atlanta, Georgia - 55 Marietta<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://speedtest.hostus.us/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Click here</a>&nbsp;for speedtest files and online speed test.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(255,0,0)\">Best regards,</span><br>\n<br>\nHostUS</div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
