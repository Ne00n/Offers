SSD\u2019s utilize no moving parts and run solely on flash memory. This allows TurnKey Turbo VPS\u2019s to run ultra-fast and resourcefully. At the core of the TurnKey Turbo VPS is Intel\u2019s\u00ae E5 Deca-Core technology, which increases speeds up to ten times that of a traditional, Quad-Core nodes.<br>\n<br>\nThese drives offer one hundred thousand IOPS (input/output per second) per drive. There are multiple SSD disks and multiple Deca-Core CPU\u2019s in each node, configured in RAID-10, using high-performance RAID cards with significant on-board caching capabilities. This is the most innovative, highest-performing node configuration on the market, and a ground-breaking alternative to the other cloud Virtual Server and VPS options out there.<br>\n<br>\nThe TurnKey Turbo VPS line is a top-of-the-line hosting solution for webmasters, businesses, and individuals, alike.

With our new on-site solar power system, we produce our own energy. The energy we use in excess of that comes from clean, renewable, hydro-electric power, sourced from Niagara Falls, New York, at a substantially reduced cost for power compared to traditional data centers. Our other green technology investments, such as Smart Aisle precision cooling and cold containment systems, provide an additional 33% efficiency over traditional data centers, further reducing our electricity utilization. This all adds up to entirely renewable electricity, and a zero carbon footprint, as evidenced by our EPA ENERGY STAR certification. Ultimately, this adds up to a lower cost of providing our reliable service.&nbsp; Lastly, we own and operate our own facility, servers, routers, and network connections.&nbsp; We are not resellers or wholesalers, so we do not have the higher operating costs of renting servers and equipment. This allows us to pass down the savings to our customers.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Where are the servers located?</b><br>\nThese specials are available in our ENERGY STAR certified, <a href=\"https://www.turnkeyinternet.net/green-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GREEN</a> data center, in New York\u2019s Tech Valley Region.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Do you have a money back guarantee?</b><br>\nYes.
