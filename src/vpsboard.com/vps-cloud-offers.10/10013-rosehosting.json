There have even been a couple times when I asked a favor of them and was surprised by the willingness to help along with immediate results.\n</div>\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink\"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>Michael Cordova<br>\n<blockquote class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent \">\nThe hosting I need for my companies and customers is non-standard in many ways. Performance is a top requirement, and as such, many custom server configurations and Wordpress website settings need to be tweaked in order to get every last second off of the page load times. The crew at Rose Hosting has stuck with me through thick and thin to solve the most difficult of problems. There have been times that I thought it was impossible, but their tech support has the skills to get it right, every time. I highly recommend Rose Hosting and their excellent support team if you need website hosting above and beyond anything that is normal.\n</div>\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink\"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>Michael Bunnell<br>\n<blockquote class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\">\n<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent \">\nRoseHosting provides excellent service at a fair price.
