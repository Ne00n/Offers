We just want you all to know that we\u2019re more than just another provider, we are customers too. We know what customers want, and we focus on exactly that! We\u2019re also Catalyst customers ourselves! We want the best out of everything we get, and we\u2019ll work hard to make sure you get the best we can give!<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our Philosophy</b><br>\nIf you're not going to do something right, don't bother doing it. Catalyst Host has been in business since early 2011. We are not here to give you the most imaginary resources you can't use for the least dollar signs. We are here to give you the best quality, with what I estimate to be some of the least oversold nodes in our market. You have the peace of mind that you services are in good hands, that your service will operate as expected, and that your data will remain safe.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our Dedication to Quality Networks and Powerful Hardware</b><br>\nThe network behind our Dallas servers is multi-homed with multiple 10Gbit connections and redundant Juniper routing with HSRP failover. Network and hardware conditions are monitored 24/7/365. Spare hardware is always stocked and available on site. We utilize A+B power for redundancy in case of brownouts, which are rare in Dallas. As a standard we use dual E5 Intel Xeon Processors with a minimum of 64GB of Ram and Raid 10 setup with 4 to 8 Enterprise Grade Drives. Recently we started using SSD Cache on our KVM Node(s). These Node(s) currently have 6 Enterprise Grade Drives in Raid 10 and 2 SSD Drives in Raid 1 for Cache. You can expect this to be a standard on future nodes.<br>\nOur VPSs are located in Dallas, TX. We utilize the Incero Network inside CoreXchange. While we do not own our hardware, we are renting some of the finest hardware available. This is a choice that we made to guarantee the quality of our services.<br>\n<br>\n<b>EACH PLAN COMES WITH</b><ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">SolusVM Control Panel</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Free DNS Hosting</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Weekly Off Site Backup</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Instant Setup</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">1Gbps Fair Share Port</li>\n</ul>Test IP: <a href=\"http://192.211.54.101/test/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://192.211.54.101/test/</a><br>\n<br>\n<b>Tall KVM</b><ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">RAM: 256MB</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Cores: 1 CPU Core @ 2.0GHz+</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">15GB RAID10 Storage with SSD Cache</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">1 TB Bandwidth</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">1 IPv4 Address</li>\n</ul><b>Price: $30.00/year</b> or <b>$15/semi </b><b><a href=\"https://portal.catalysthost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=53&amp;promocode=VPSBkvmPROMO\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a> </b>(VPSBkvmPROMO) 75% Off for LIFE<br>\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<b>Trenta OpenVZ</b><ul>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">RAM: 2048MB</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">vSwap: 512MB</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Cores: 4 CPU Core @ 2.0GHz+</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">60GB RAID10 Storage</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">2 TB Bandwidth</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">1 IPv4 Address</li>\n</ul><b>Price:</b> <b>$7.00/month</b> <a href=\"https://portal.catalysthost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=45\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><b>ORDER NOW</b></a><br>\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\n<br>\nQuestions?
