Both expire in November, one on the tenth, one on the 12th. They are both from their $12/year 256MB promo, but they both have upgrades. Here's the deal:<br>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ol\">256MB memory, 15GB disk, 500GB BW, 2 IP addresses, originally $16/yr, Quadranet LA</li>\n<li data-xf-list-type=\"ol\">512MB memory, 15GB disk, 500GB BW, 1 IP address, originally $24/yr, Colocrossing Buffalo</li>\n</ol>There's about a third of a year left until mid-November when these expire, so that comes to about $5.30 for the first one and $8 for the second. However I'm asking for $4 for the first and $6 for the second, $8 for both. Secondhand VPSes? Maybe. I prefer \"bargains\". Either way <img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile    :)\" data-shortname=\":)\"> URPad is happy to move them between accounts, or even locations if you want these in a different place. I've been happy with URPad, but I'm trying to trim down my VPS collection.</div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
