WebSound are a registered company in the UK, and we're also registered under the EU VAT MOSS Scheme (VAT No: GB 203 0289 55).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe know our clients want access to high performnace, affordable services which make use of the latest technologies, we're therefore pleased to announce the launch of our new Premium KVM SSD VPS servers. These VPS servers are fantastic, and that's why they're Premium! We've based these VPS on Intel E3 Processors with 4 Samsung SSD Drives in an LSI RAID 10 array to offer you disk transfer speeds of up to 1GB/s, not only that, these nodes are packed with only 32GB of RAM, meaning that you'll have a very small number of other VPS sharing the same node as your VPS, compared to other VPS ranges which can have up to 128GB RAM per node. These new VPS are absolutely fantastic, and would be great for performance necessary services, such as game servers or large database driven websites, so to top it off, we're throwing in DDoS Protection of up to 10Gbps/10Mpps, absolutely free! These VPS are currently available in Los Angeles, with additional locations lined up for the future.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>KVMSP256 Package:</b><br>\n256mb RAM<br>\n256mb SWAP<br>\n8GB RAID 10 SSD Disk Space<br>\n1TB Monthly Bandwidth<br>\n1 E3 CPU Core<br>\nThis package costs \u00a33.20 / $4.75&nbsp;/ \u20ac4.33&nbsp;per month with promotional code <b>CHRISTMAS2015</b><br>\n<a href=\"https://websound.co.uk/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=146\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Click here to order this package!</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>KVMSP512&nbsp;Package:</b><br>\n512mb RAM<br>\n512mb SWAP<br>\n10GB RAID 10 SSD Disk Space<br>\n2TB Monthly Bandwidth<br>\n1 E3 CPU Core<br>\nThis package costs \u00a34.40&nbsp;/ $6.53&nbsp;/ \u20ac5.95&nbsp;per month with promotional code <b>CHRISTMAS2015</b><br>\n<a href=\"https://websound.co.uk/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=147\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Click here to order this package!</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>KVMSP1024&nbsp;Package:</b><br>\n1GB RAM<br>\n1GB SWAP<br>\n20GB RAID 10 SSD Disk Space<br>\n3TB Monthly Bandwidth<br>\n2 E3 CPU Cores<br>\nThis package costs \u00a36.40&nbsp;/ $9.50&nbsp;/ \u20ac8.65&nbsp;per month with promotional code <b>CHRISTMAS2015</b><br>\n<a href=\"https://websound.co.uk/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=148\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Click here to order this package!</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMore packages are available over at our website by clicking <b><a href=\"https://websound.co.uk/vps.php?type=ssd\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a></b>!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u><b>Hardware</b></u><br>\nIntel E3-1230v3 Processor<br>\n32GB DDR3 RAM<br>\n4 x 512GB Samsung SSD Drives, LSI Hardware RAID 10<br>\n1Gbps Uplink<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u><b>Available Locations</b></u><br>\nUS - Los Angeles - <a href=\"http://lg.la.websound.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LookingGlass</a>&nbsp;- Test IP: 23.91.14.131<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe promotional code CHRISTMAS2015 is valid until 3rd January 2016 and will give you a 20% recurring discount on any of our services, on any billing cycle.
