The website automatically publishes a new offer each day at noon (EST // GMT -5) based on the next offer in queue. The offers are listed in the order they're received, which we believe is the best method and the most fair. Daily Server Deals is a vpsBoard project that can be read about here: <a href=\"https://vpsboard.com/topic/2128-daily-server-deals-has-launched/\" class=\"link link--internal\">http://vpsboard.com/topic/2128-daily-server-deals-has-launched/</a><br>\n<br>\nGetting setup is quite easy, though I understand it may not be as straight forward at a quick glance. I hope this short guide makes it simple for you.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 24px\"><b>Step 1</b>:</span> If you've not already registered an account, you can do so here: <a href=\"http://dailyserverdeals.com/accounts/register/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://dailyserverdeals.com/accounts/register/</a> This is just a standard user account. This account allows you to comment on offers, subscribe/follow offers (get notified of new offers from your favorite companies), etc.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 24px\"><b>Step 2: </b></span>To obtain a <b><u>provider</u></b> account, this must be created manually by myself. The process is simple and once your provider account is created it's part of your standard account. There aren't two logins. After a provider account has been created you'll see a new URL in the nav-bar with your company name, with menu options to manage your provider profile, add/remove/edit your service locations and details, etc.<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"lbContainer lbContainer--inline\" title=\"\" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-_xfUid-1-1608094916\" data-lb-id=\"_xfUid-1-1608094916\">\n<div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-_xfUid-1-1608094916\" data-src=\"http://imgs.vpsboard.com/sKOCQ7oQ70msFqM.png\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div>\n<img src=\"https://imgs.vpsboard.com/sKOCQ7oQ70msFqM.png\" data-url=\"http://imgs.vpsboard.com/sKOCQ7oQ70msFqM.png\" class=\"bbImage\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" style=\"\">\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"lbContainer lbContainer--inline\" title=\"\" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-_xfUid-2-1608094916\" data-lb-id=\"_xfUid-2-1608094916\">\n<div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-_xfUid-2-1608094916\" data-src=\"http://imgs.vpsboard.com/k8utHlKHDl43Mr3.png\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div>\n<img src=\"https://imgs.vpsboard.com/k8utHlKHDl43Mr3.png\" data-url=\"http://imgs.vpsboard.com/k8utHlKHDl43Mr3.png\" class=\"bbImage\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" style=\"\">\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\nSimply let me know via PM, via this thread, Skype, or any other contact method you may have for me.

Let me know.<br>\n<br>\nRight now I'm looking to re-build the offer queue before promoting the site heavier and looking forward to providers submitting new offers. Please let me know if you need me to do anything for you, as I'll be happy to get you setup with a provider account and add any datacenter that may not be in the list, etc.</div>\n<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
