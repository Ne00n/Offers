How long have you been around?  \r\nA: UltraVPS is a division of Versaweb - the guys who sell awesome, cheap dedicated servers. We've been providing VPS hosting services since 2008.  \r\n  \r\nQ: What locations are available?  \r\nA: All plans are currently available in our Las Vegas, NV (Fiberhub) and Seattle, WA (Westin) datacenters.  \r\n  \r\nQ: Is there any kind of guarantee?   \r\nA: Buy it and try it for 10 days. if it sucks, we'll give you your money back (as long as you didn't do anything stupid, like SPAM).   \r\n  \r\nQ: How fast will you have my VPS online?  \r\nA: We manually review orders from new customers to keep fraud to a minimum, which allows us to keep our pricing low. Usually we'll have you up within just a couple of hours.  \r\n  \r\nQ: Are these managed or unmanaged plans?   \r\nA: These VPS plans are unmanaged. We'll try and help out where we can via our ticket system, but at the end of the day It's all you.   \r\n  \r\nQ: Do these Promo VPS plans include backups?   \r\nA: No, backups are not included, but will be available as an add-on soon.   \r\n  \r\nQ: Do you offer Windows on these VPS plans?   \r\nA: Nope - these plans are Linux only. Windows will be available on our standard VPS plans which will be available in a few weeks.   \r\n  \r\nQ: Do you have a test IP?   \r\nA: Sure!  \r\n  \r\nLas Vegas - 199.47.210.50  \r\nSeattle - 76.164.234.1  \r\n  \r\nQ: Who are your network providers?   \r\nA: NTT, Hibernia, HE.net, TW Telecom, and dozens of private peering arrangements. Check it out - [AS53340](http://bgp.he.net/AS53340)  \r\n  \r\nQ: Can I get IPv6?   \r\nA: Not yet, but soon. We promise. Our network is 100% v6 ready, but we're still testing out some of the new v6 features in SolusVM. Once we're happy, we'll roll it out at no added cost.   \r\n  \r\nQ: How does your DDoS protection work?   \r\nA: Our system automatically detects incoming attacks and null routes the targeted IP, thereby minimizing collateral damage and keeping you online even if you have virtual neighbors who aren't so nice. We offer enterprise-grade DDoS MITIGATION too - contact our Sales dept. if you are interested.   \r\n  \r\nQ: How can I use my VPS? Any restrictions?  \r\nA: No TOR, no torrents, nothing illegal, no SPAM, no DDoS attacks, etc. Basically, don't do anything stupid, and we'll all get along just fine.  \r\n  \r\nThanks for reading, and have a good day!
