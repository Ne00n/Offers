I don't want anything for this VPS, so it's completely free to you assuming you want to continue paying for it. I already asked @Damian and he said it would be fine. Also this VPS is due tomorrow (billing starts on the 7th of each month so you would need to pay it).  \r\n\r\nHere are the specs:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n256MB memory\r\n320MB Burst\r\n10GB storage\r\n300GB/month data transfer @ 100mbit\r\n12 vCPU core\r\nOpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nJust @ me if you want it and we'll talk. Thanks LET!\r\n\r\n(By the way the VPS is on diamond)\r\n"}
