We have added tons of new features, like migration of KVM containers between nodes, creation of private networks devices, remote access to SPICE console and many more. We have also improved many aspects of the modules to make them even more user-friendly.\r\n\r\nThe changes affect all aspects of the modules so make sure you do not forget to update your **Proxmox VPS For WHMCS** and **Proxmox Cloud For WHMCS!** This is the final beta version so feel free to share your opinion [**here**](https://www.modulesgarden.com/customers/support).\r\n\r\n**Despite so many new features and improvements, price of both products remains unchanged!**\r\n\r\nWe were also trying to implement HTML5 console but due to the lack of Proxmox API support we have had to cease the work.
