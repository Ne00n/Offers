Why is it so cheap!?!?* **  \r\nWe know that many things usually included with a VPS service are unnecessary for a tiny non-critical server.  \r\nYou might need a server for testing your new web app, monitoring your other servers, or hosting your personal website, and you want it to be as affordable as possible.  \r\nAnd because we've launched this brand recently, we want everyone to know how great our services are!\r\n\r\n** *What virtualization technology you use?* **  \r\nWe use OpenVZ as container-based virtualization technology, which provides proper isolation and almost zero overhead by sharing the same kernel.\r\n\r\n** *How can I pay?* **  \r\nWe accept all major Credit/Debit cards such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express. We also accept PayPal.\r\n\r\n** *I need something better for my production projects. Can you help me?* **  \r\nSure we can! While ClickVPS.net is suitable for development or staging projects, we also provide enterprise level services under our main brand Andrino Telecom for your production needs.  \r\nDrop us a line at support(at)andrinotelecom.net and we will be happy to help you! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2606\u2605 **More questions?** \u2605\u2606\u2605  \r\nWe're happy to help!
