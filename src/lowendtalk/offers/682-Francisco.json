We've setup a test node and are giving away 20 - 30 1GB vm's for free for the better part of a month.\n\n- 1GB guaranteed RAM\n- 1GB virtual SWAP\n- 60GB RAID10 storage\n- 3000GB monthly transit\n- 1 x IPV4 &amp; 16 x IPV6\n\nPlease be aware that any abuse (ddos, spam, etc) from this VPS will lead to termination and it **will** be held against your whole account with us. \n\nWe fully expect bug reports of any issues you're spotting and both positive &amp; negative feedback over how vswap is performing for you.\n\nPlease also be aware that there is **no** SLA provided with these VM's. The main reason for this testing is to help us find out how stable vswap is. While others have reported issues with the kernel, they were all using newer CPU's which we gather are likely just extremely picky.\n\nIf you're willing to lend a hand, please sign up at:\n\nhttps://my.frantech.ca/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=99&amp;carttpl=cart\n\nThanks!\n\nFrancisco"}
