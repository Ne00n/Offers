We use AS200039, with DDoS protection through Voxility up to 500Gbps. Always on protection and layer 7 protection can be turned on/off by request, but we cannot add custom filters. No SLA guarantee on these offers, but if a node goes down due to an unplanned or unexplained event all VPS's affected get a free month of service :)\r\n\r\nAs this is a DDoS protected offer, there will be times that attacks will filter through and cause packet loss. This offer is not suitable for running anything that requires a permanent connection such as IRC, due to the shared nature of the DDoS protection. Thank you for your understanding! \r\n\r\nAll VPS's are backed up offsite on a weekly basis, and fees may be charged for user requested restoration.\r\n\r\n**Extra IP's are $12 a year with justification - [Read TOS before ordering](https://dedistation.com/TOS.html) (No virtual currency, Tor, utilising 100% CPU or Hitleap without asking).
