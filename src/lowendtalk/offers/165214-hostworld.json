The best of every world with this company. Highly recommended for all types of hosting needs. Andrew specifically has been great to work with.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Excellent Team**\r\n&gt; Switched to HostWorld a few months ago and literally could not be any more happier. I've been in this game for 20 years and the service these guys provide is the best I've experienced. They have gone above and beyond from the start. Highly recommend!\r\n\r\n&gt; **Excellent service so far, a provider you will want to stick with.**\r\n&gt; I've been with hostworld for just over 3 months as I was looking for a reliable UK unmanaged KVM VPS provider that offered unmetered bandwidth and decent hardware for a fair price. So far hostworld has been consistently good. I have not run into any problems with the service. As far as their support goes, their support so far has been excellent. The two times I have opened a ticket (only for RDNS changes) they have been answered and resolved quickly. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I would definitely recommend hostworld to individuals looking for stable and affordable services that include a friendly support team that truly cares.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Excellent Service. Exemplary Staff.**\r\n&gt; I\u2019ve worked in the IT Industry for many years. Far back. Back to the days where we painted in caves and when men like me were referred to simply as the \u2018Computer Man\u2019. I\u2019ve never; not ever written a product or company review so this is a first for me. However, I felt moved to write a review about HostWorld.uk. I\u2019ve had stuff hosted with various companies over many years. I\u2019ve experienced a few really good hosting companies, some average and as has mostly been the case, some terribly mediocre. My experience with HostWorld.uk and the service as well as the quality of tech support I\u2019ve received from them is, without question, one of the best if not the very best I ever had from any hosting provider. My migration to you will be my last. Thank you so much guys. Great job. Keep up the good work.\r\n\r\n&gt; **I am very happy**\r\n&gt; I am very happy with the service I have received from Hostworld so far.\r\n&gt; Support has been great, they seem to go out of their way to fix issues and in my case they installed an OS they do not use. The server itself preforms very well, no slow downs so far I have no complaints.\r\n&gt; I would recommend them to anyone.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Great support, reliable service**\r\n&gt; Great support and very attentive. I'm their customer for about a month now and I didn't face any issue so far. Their VPS are fast, stable and affordable. I would definitely recommend hostworld.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Second to none**\r\n&gt; Super friendly, knowledgeable - anything, anytime, nothing is too much for them and they will happily do the best they can to cater to your needs. I found them whilst looking to expand the locations I offer on an existing business where uptime, speed and reliability is a must and has to be second to none. I am happy to say that hostworld ticks all the boxes. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I joined hostworld 3 months ago and I can see myself becoming a life long customer.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Amazing and friendly support**\r\n&gt; Amazing and friendly support! Honestly after being on this business since 2012 I have never encountered such an honest, helpful and understanding team of people, coupled with a fantastic service with even greater price!\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Thank you very much for everything.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n**Payment Methods**\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWe currently accept payment through the following:\r\n\r\n- PayPal\r\n- Credit/Debit Card\r\n- Bank Transfer\r\n- Apple Pay\r\n- Bitcoin\r\n- Alipay\r\n- Unionpay\r\n\r\nAll plans come with no contracts!
