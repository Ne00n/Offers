My endeavour is simple: to provide a viable alternative VPS solution for anyone who needs a high-performance SSD VPS here in the UK.\r\n\r\nI've created a customised configuration using the latest solid state drives to deliver up to 240K IOPS or around 1.5-2GB/s of disk IO for the most demanding applications. To put that into perspective, that's around 200x faster than a typical hard disk, and around 2-4x faster than a typical solid state drive.\r\n\r\nVPSs are hosted on server-grade hardware with Intel Xeon E3 processors, DDR3 memory and fast, UK bandwidth. I have set up these servers using the OpenVZ virtualisation software to enable easy management, reduce your resource overheads and keep your costs low. Management is via the SolusVM console.\r\n\r\n**256MB RAM\r\n3GB SSD (230K IOPS)\r\n100GB Bandwidth\r\n\u00a34.49/month ($7 USD) with coupon 5O63CUJ1PY\r\n[Order](https://www.killerio.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1)**\r\n\r\nTest IP: 194.0.252.80\r\nTest Download: [100MB](http://www.vooservers.com/100mb.bin)\r\nData Centre: Custodian DC in Kent, UK (Level3 Bandwidth!)\r\n\r\nNote: There will be a slight (24-48 hrs) delay provisioning orders as the equipment has just been ordered."}
