Currently paying 50 USD per month (i.e., the first option), you can convert to colo-only option with 30USD per month. I've had it since Jan 2013.\r\n\r\nSpecs are as follows:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nHP SE1102 with:\r\nDual Xeon L5420\r\n24 GB DDR2\r\n4x500 GB HDDs\r\nP400 HP Raid Controller w/ Hardware Raid 10\r\n\r\n2x /29 block (1 came for the server, 1 block was added to me as a goodwill from Dacentec)\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the specs:\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/6XKqe\r\n\r\nThey can loan IPMI for free for 24 hours, and are normally pretty quick in getting back to me on whatever request that I have.\r\n\r\nAsking for $550 USD, via Paypal only.\r\n\r\nInterested please PM me.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not a server provider and there will be no money back guarantee nor \"trial period\" for this server. It is sold as \"it-is\", obviously there is nothing wrong with the machine (it was assembled by Dacentec in Dacentec and I have never seen it myself as well) and comes with the warranty from Dacentec if you can stick to the 50/month payment plan.\r\n\r\nDacentec also offers 10% annual payment discount."}
