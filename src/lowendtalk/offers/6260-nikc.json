Count all of the facebook likes on all the posts on a wordpress site by month\r\n2. Calculate the likes per author (there are two)\r\n3. Create 2 widgets, both showing the number of likes per author and showing if the author with the most likes is in 1st or second place\r\n\r\nAnyone here able to do this ? or recommend where to look ?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNik"}
