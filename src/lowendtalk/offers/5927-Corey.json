This is in Dallas, TX - CoreXChange facility.\r\n\r\nRight now we have 3 D425 Atom Servers in stock - Rent one for 8 months @ $30/mo and you own it.\r\nIt comes with 5TB Bandwidth/mo (100mbit port)\r\n40GB Hard Drive (might throw in another 40gb if we have some on hand)\r\n1GB RAM\r\n1 IPV4 (extra ipv4 at $1/mo )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also have some other rent to own deals so just contact us if you are interested in a higher end machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: How much for colo after the 8 months?\r\nA: It's negotiable, but this deal is only for the rent to own period. After the rent to own period I'm not sure if we could continue this deal. We could probably offer something very similar for the colo though."}
