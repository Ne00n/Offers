Initially only offering HK VPS but will expand to Europe and USA if the feedback is positive.\r\n\r\nThis is not going to be life-time free VPS. So I would like to offer upto 10 free VPS on a single node for the sole purpose of testing the platform, performance and just getting a feel for general user experience.\r\n\r\nSingle test node has been deployed.\r\n\r\nVMs will be as follows:\r\n\r\n1GB RAM  \r\n1vCPU  \r\n40GB HDD  \r\nKVM Hypervisor  \r\nBandwidth to be determined but around 200GB+/- for HK  \r\nPrice, also to be determined, but within LET pricing.  \r\n\r\nTest period may last until the end of the year. Anyone interested?\r\n"}
