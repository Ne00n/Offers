We're planning on starting up a new VPS service relatively soon and are ready to start testing out our VPS Panel. We are able to use it, but now we want to see what our customer's thoughts are on the panel. As such, we have set up a couple of packages as a beta. The packages we currently offer are as follows:\r\n\r\nOpenVZ 1GB\r\n----------\r\n* 1IP Address\r\n* 1GB DDR3 1333Mhz ECC RAM\r\n* 20GB RAID-1 HDD Space\r\n* Free DDoS Protection (300Gbps)\r\n* 1Gbps Port\r\n* 2TB Bandwidth\r\n$7/m\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Removed 2GB one. Also disabled taxes for the package.\r\n\r\nYou can check out these plans here (https://billing.perfectionhosting.us/cart.php?gid=8). If you have any questions, send in a reply here, or contact me through our site.\r\n\r\nEDIT: There is a setup fee, but if you use the code \"leb921\" it will waive it for you."}
