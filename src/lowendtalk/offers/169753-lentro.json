I ordered a bulk preorder of NVIDIA's 30-series GPUs right after they launched for a November delivery, and now it's already February (although I've been receiving random tiny shipments for the past few months). Apparently they shipped a bit more a week ago, but I have no idea whether 1 or 25 are coming and when due to terrible comms. Anyways, I've got servers all built waiting for GPUs to be put inside, and I'm tired of waiting, so let me buy your high-end graphics card! \r\n\r\nI obviously won't be able to fill all the missing GPU spots, but I'm just going crazy right now. \r\n\r\nI am looking for NVIDIA 20-series and above (e.g. RTX 2060, 2080 Ti, Quadro 6000, etc.) from U.S. based people (shipping is cheaper). \r\n\r\n_Why sell to me_\r\n- Many people trust me. Don't worry abt chargebacks\r\n- Cut out the middleman. No eBay taking 10% fees when we deal directly\r\n- Do you _really_ need that X fps in that game? You can use your computer just fine with an older graphics card! \r\n- I have spare 1650s. I can pay with an older GPU + cash\r\n\r\nPM me your offers, although please don't exceed MSRP if they are used please!\r\n\r\nTake the money and wait 'till prices fall haha. \r\n\r\n(Mods, please remove if this is against the rules. Can't find any rules on \"providers\" buying from \"customers\" though :lol: )"}
