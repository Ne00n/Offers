It has 1 TB samsung drive (3 more 3.5 bays available), unmettered 1 gbps link (best effort, 250 mbps guaranteed) with autonull in case of DDoS, 36 GB RAM, full BMC (IPMI from DELL). With 2 IPv4 and 2 IPv6, I can rent it to you for 300 Eur/3 months, cheaper for longer terms, no monthly, please. You can use black's speedtest for EU, the Bucharest entry is from one of my servers there. For longer term rent, I can put another 1 TB drive in.  \r\nIf you do not manage to install the os over IPMI, i can do that too for a small fee.  No illegal stuff hosting, if I get complaints, the contract will be terminated. I will issue invoice, VAT 24% for EU people without VAT registration, rent to own possible, also selling it and setting up a contract in your name with the DC. PM me for other propositions, I am flexible.  \r\nThis has nothing to do with prometeus, I will issue the invoices from my own company.  \r\nPayment via Bank transfer, when the payment is received, the server will be made available in a few hours.\r\n\r\nI can carve it in big VPSes too, if you only need something like that, selling is also an option, with or without drives, with more or less ram, depending on your needs. More IPs are available on demand, 1 Eur per piece."}
