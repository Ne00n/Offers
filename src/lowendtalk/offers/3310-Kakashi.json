On this occasion I am happy to be able to offer all of our VPS packages with 50% off for life. There is limited stock available.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can get for your $7 with the Basic Package.\r\n\r\n-&gt; 20GB Raid 10 Storage\r\n-&gt; 512MB Dedicated RAM\r\n-&gt; 2 CPU Cores\r\n-&gt; 1TB Bandwidth on a 100mbit connection.\r\n-&gt; VMware Web Control Panel Access (Upon Request).\r\n-&gt; Complimentary weekly backups.\r\n\r\n[https://corgitech.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=10](https://corgitech.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=10) and use code : **CORGI50**\r\n\r\nWe don't have an expiry code for the above offer but I suspect we'll be sold out within a week judging by the last time we had this promotion here. So don't delay for too long.\r\n\r\nWe have a few customers here on Lowendbox who I am sure will vouch for our support and quality of service.\r\n\r\nTest IP and files for both locations can be found at the bottom of our VPS page : [http://www.corgitech.com/linux_vps.html](http://www.corgitech.com/linux_vps.html)\r\n\r\nIPv6 is available for our UK, USA EAST and USA WEST (Phoenix) locations only. \r\n\r\n_Domain Name registration, Cpanel and Management options are exlcuded from the offer. IRC , Anonymous Proxies, Medium to Heavy Video Encoding, Seedboxes etc... are not permitted._"}
