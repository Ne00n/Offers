Torrents/Filesharing however, are allowed.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**The Expectation**&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe expect a well detailed review in terms of performance and your thoughts if this VPS would be something you would buy or recommend to others.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**To Apply**&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you think the 10Gbps will help you benefit over the 1Gbps. I will select the candidates based on the replies here.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nJD @ 2Host"}
