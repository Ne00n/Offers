It was incredibly popular and, when it ran out of stock, people continually asked me to bring it back. For the time being, it has no stock limit and I have no idea when this plan is going to be cut off. It's massive popularity makes it a bit difficult to tune the stock to zero, despite planning to do so multiple times.\r\n\r\nSo here's a few of the features of MXroute:  \r\n- IMAP/SMTP/POP3  \r\n- Plus address aliasing (youremail+alias@yourdomain)  \r\n- Spammy neighbor doesn't impact you at all  \r\n- cPanel control panel (&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=12\"&gt;Why cPanel? How are you unique?&lt;/a&gt;)  \r\n- Support... we offer it  \r\n- MailChannels for incredibly consistent delivery  \r\n- Daily off-site backups  \r\n- Servers physically overseen in local datacenter  \r\n- RAID10 on all servers for protection against drive failure  \r\n\r\nHere's what I'm offering:  \r\n- 40GB Storage  \r\n- Unlimited Domains  \r\n- Unlimited Email Accounts  \r\n- $40 for two years (recurring)\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=47\"&gt;Click here to order.&lt;/a&gt;"}
