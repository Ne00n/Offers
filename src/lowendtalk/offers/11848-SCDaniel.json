[StatusCake](https://www.statuscake.com) for those who don\u2019t know (and don\u2019t worry we\u2019re only partly offended that you don\u2019t know us!) is a service uptime monitor \u2013 that is to say it will alert you if your website or service goes down. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re not some fly by night service \u2013 in fact we\u2019ve got some huge clients (take a look at our homepage) but it\u2019s not just the huge corporates that we want to help but rather the smaller guys and girls that have set in motion the thousands of changes StatusCake has made in the past year. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re fully integrated into the likes of Geckoboard, Pagerduty, Zapier, Pushover, Boxcar and more \u2013 so you can get alerts the way you want. Our paid plans start from \u00a33.49 but with the coupon: BUBASU-LOW-END you can get 30% off for subscription life \u2013 but frankly give our free service a try and see why we\u2019re shouting so loudly. \r\n\r\nCheers for the memories, and onto the next year!\r\nDaniel.\r\n\r\n_(p.s. Although the rule is this section is for hosting only Liam gave his blessing to the last offer post I made about 5 months ago, so basing being able to post this of the back of that!)_"}
