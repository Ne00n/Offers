Being that this is a service I am offering at no charge, be aware that I will terminate your VM if I even have a suspicion of illegal activity (SPAM included).\r\n\r\nI provide no warranty on this service and simply offer it to people looking for a VM for dev or learning or games.\r\n\r\n**This offer is open to Canadian and US residents only.**\r\n\r\nTest IP: 162.248.208.98\r\nLocation: Atlanta GA (QuickPacket)"}
