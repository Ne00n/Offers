There is no specific order form where you can pick / choose the model on offer. I will be updating this thread periodically to show which servers are still available. AFTER you submit your order, reserve the model of your choice right here on this thread. Whoever posts first gets priority for that particular model.\r\n\r\n[Register here](https://www.hosthongkong.net/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=124)\r\n\r\n**Hong Kong Dedicated Servers** _With Direct China Routes_\r\n\r\nMS01 - i3-3220T, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\nMS41 - i3-4130, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\nMS07 - i7-3770, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\nES04 - Xeon X3430, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\n&lt;del&gt;ES06 - Xeon X3430, 8GB RAM, 2TB HDD&lt;/del&gt;  \r\n&lt;del&gt;SVR25 - Xeon E3-1220v2, 8GB RAM, 2x500GB HDD&lt;/del&gt;  \r\n\r\nAll servers include as standard 1IPv4 Address and 1TB data transfer (with direct China route). \r\n\r\n\r\n**Hong Kong Dedicated Servers** _NO CHINA ROUTE_\r\n\r\nMS02 - i3-3240, 2x250GB SSD, 16GB RAM  \r\nMS22 - Xeon E3-1225v2, 2TB HDD, 16GB RAM  \r\nMS30 - Xeon E3-1230v3, 2x1TB HDD, 8GB RAM  \r\nSVR50 - Xeon E3-1245v2, 2x1TB HDD, 16GB RAM  \r\nSVR41 - Xeon E3-1270v3, 2x500GB HDD, 16GB RAM  \r\nSVR36 - Xeon L5520, 3TB HDD, 32GB RAM  \r\n\r\nAll the servers include as standard 1IPv4 Address and 10TB data transfer (without China Route)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recurring fee for all servers is **$49 /month** each.  \r\n\r\nYes I know some servers are higher spec than others, but with a LET limit of $49/m, not much wiggle room I'm afraid.  \r\n\r\nSetup Time - 1 Working Day  \r\n\r\n[Click here to sign up!](https://www.hosthongkong.net/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=124)  \r\n\r\nGeneral stuff applies. No abuse of any kind! So no SPAM, no hacking sites, no warez sites etc. None of that allowed. Rule of thumb is, if it's legal and doesn't attract DDoS, then it's okay! If you have to ask, it's probably NOT okay.
