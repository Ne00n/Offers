With our range of powerful server resources, we wanted to provide heavy media and application-based hosting that will not fail under the stress that is created by media-based websites and applications. We continue to use our rule on overselling. We do not do it and will sell what we have, so you know that when you order your hosting plan that the hosting space is dedicated to you, not anyone else.\r\n\r\nHost Media Ltd | Company Registration No. 10990171\r\nVAT No. GB283897147 | UK EORI No. GB283897147000\r\n\r\n**Questions?**\r\nWe are always here to help with any questions you may have, feel free to open a sales ticket via our helpdesk.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n* Offer ends 03/DEC/2021\r\n* New &amp; current customers can apply the discount\r\n* VAT will be applied after a discount is applied\r\n* All prices are in GBP\r\n* Stock is limited so once we sell out we will update our ordering system to reflect the status\r\n* Traffic is fair usage on a 1Gbps network"}
