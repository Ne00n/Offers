Please note that the actual [offer page](http://offer.vpn.sh) is one day ahead of here, due to awaiting confirmation from admins here that posting is not a problem. I've started this thread at day 1 @ \u00a31/year in order to ensure nobody here misses out on the lowest pricing, regardless of what the [offer page](http://offer.vpn.sh) states._"}
