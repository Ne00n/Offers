Ransom IT now has 4 POPs in independent locations on 3 separate AS networks with the most recent additions being Melbourne (SoftLayer) and Auckland (Vibe Communications). We have been in the hosting business since 2007 and offering VPS services since 2010.\r\n\r\nIn October we successfully changed our upstream provider in Sydney to Vibe Communications which has significantly improved network performance and reliability in this location for all customers. This upstream provider is used for our Sydney and Auckland POPs and peers heavily in Los Angeles and at LINX in London so latency from both locations to American and European locations is excellent; likely amongst the best in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe new Melbourne POP is on the highly regarded SoftLayer network which has excellent connectivity into Asia with dedicated capacity to Hong Kong and Japan. Our Adelaide presence primarily uses VOCUS for connectivity which provides consistent performance for domestic customers and into the South East Asian region for connectivity via Singapore and Perth.\r\n\r\nAll plans come with 1 IPv4, 10 (native) IPv6, quality upstream providers with extensive local peering. Basic DDOS mitigation via NSFOCUS hardware is available in Sydney and Auckland by default. Sydney, Auckland and Melbourne feature gigabit uplinks. Adelaide is up to 100mbit. We use Solus and PTR requests must be submitted by ticket.\r\n\r\nCheck out our looking glasses to find the best location for you:\r\n\r\n* **Adelaide (Colocity):** http://adelaide-lg.ransomit.com.au/\r\n* **Sydney (Vibe Communications, Equinix SY3):** http://sydney-lg.ransomit.com.au/\r\n* **Melbourne (SoftLayer):** http://melbourne-lg.ransomit.com.au/\r\n* **Auckland (Vibe Communications, TheDataCentre):** http://auckland-lg.ransomit.com.au/\r\n\r\nCurrent offers available with prices listed in USD.\r\n\r\nFor a limited time additional IPs in Melbourne and Adelaide are $1 per month per IP, with justification required.
