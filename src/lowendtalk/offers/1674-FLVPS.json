If you use IRC, you know what \"abuse\" is.\r\n[$6.99/mo](http://flvps.net/vps-plans/)\r\n\r\nThe price used to be $4.99 but after the acquisition, the 256mb and 512mb plans went up a few dollars but the larger packages remained the same price. Check out our KVM offers! \r\n\r\n**About Us:**\r\nOur brand was acquired a few months ago by a larger managed hosting / IT business company, K&amp;J's Managed Solutions, that focuses on businesses but the decision was made to allow us to run and maintain our unmanaged clients. Pinellas Hosting, a business IT company that offered IT solutions and hosting services, previously owned FLVPS. Pinellas Hosting has an established track record, including winning a VPS benchmark competition on vpslist.net last year totally surprising \"established\" VPS providers.\r\n\r\n**Benchmarks:**\r\nhttp://vpsbenchmarks.net/benchmarks/2011/11/florida-vps-openvz-tampa-nov-2011-benchmarks/\r\n\r\nI have a 256mb VPS running since the business started that I use for goofing around on and if you need a live benchmark or request, go right ahead and ask me.\r\n\r\nThank you"}
