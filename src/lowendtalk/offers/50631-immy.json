Need anonymity as a lot of religious and corporate regions sometime feel that we are trying to work against them so these are big groups with corporate world ties. Already moved a lot around but as we are non-profit we are finding it hard to exist. Most anonymous providers out there are mostly too costly. Was looking if some lowend stuff is available but with anonymity.\r\nNothing illegal here but just some racial, religious and corporate people feel they are being opposed.\r\nPlease suggest concerned service. Only practical and anonymous workarounds welcomed. Please no lecture or debate if you have something against anonymity. Please keep views regarding anonymity away from this thread.\r\nThanks"}
