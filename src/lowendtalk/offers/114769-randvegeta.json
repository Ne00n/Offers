It will be 1st come first serve, and due to the custom nature of this offer, there is no specific order form where you can pick / choose the model on offer. So to make it fair and transparent, we'll have it first come first serve. AFTER you submit your order, reserve the model of your choice right here on this thread. Whoever posts first gets priority for that particular model.\r\n\r\nRegister [here](https://www.hosthongkong.net/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=124)\r\n\r\n**Hong Kong Dedicated Servers** _With Direct China Routes_\r\n\r\nSVR24 - C2D-E8400, 8GB RAM, 4TB HDD  \r\nMS09 - i3-3220, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\nMS03 - i3-3220, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\nMS20 - i3-3220T, 6GB RAM, 128GB SSD  \r\nSVR68 - i3-3240, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\nES04 - Xeon X3430, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\nES06 - Xeon X3430, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD  \r\n\r\nAll servers include as standard 1IPv4 Address and 1TB data transfer (with direct China route).\r\n\r\nThe recurring fee for all servers is **$49 /month** each.\r\n\r\nYes I know some servers are higher spec than others, but with a LET limit of $49/m, not much wiggle room I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nSetup Time - 1 Working Day\r\n\r\nClick [here](https://www.hosthongkong.net/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=124) to sign up!\r\n\r\nGeneral stuff applies. No abuse of any kind! So no SPAM, no hacking sites, no warez sites etc. None of that allowed. Rule of thumb is, if it's legal and doesn't attract DDoS, then it's okay! If you have to ask, it's probably NOT okay. Abusers will be terminated without notice or refund (especially spammers!).\r\n\r\nAny questions, please feel free to ask.\r\n\r\n"}
