I've been quite reluctant and, frankly, I'm convinced that I'll regret doing this. For that reason, I suggest you get in on it if you're on the fence. Sometimes I make bad decisions, but I always provide what I sell. I may very well live to regret this enough to never ever do it again.\r\n\r\nHere is the package:  \r\n- 5GB Storage  \r\n- Unlimited Domains  \r\n- Unlimited Email Accounts  \r\n- 60 outgoing emails per hour limit  \r\n- Servers in Incero Dallas  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=61\"&gt;Click here to buy&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nSome features of MXroute:\r\n\r\n- cPanel based front-end  \r\n- MailChannels for all outbound email  \r\n- Backup relays  \r\n- Frequent backups (every 1-3 days), multiple copies stored  \r\n- Full support provided  \r\n- DKIM (but seriously please stop using it, DKIM is useless and overly complex)  \r\n\r\nPLEASE READ: If you wish to switch from another plan to this, you need to purchase the new package and cancel your original. Migration of data will be up to you. The profit from this is completely lost the moment we go through all of that by hand just to get anyone set up to pay us less. I'll allow it, I respect anyone's desire to pay less, but please be considerate of our time on this."}
