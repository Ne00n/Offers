This was designed to be the solution for affordable mail hosting with a \"bring your own domain\" system. Since that time MXroute has grown up quite a bit. I would like to offer LET members two promotion codes for our services.\r\n\r\nPromo Code: TRYMX&lt;br&gt;\r\n20% off, non-recurring discount.\r\n\r\nPromo Code: MX10&lt;br&gt;\r\n10% off, recurring discount.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Features:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\n- Z-Push&lt;br&gt;\r\nActiveSync compatible push services for your devices. Some devices may not work, Z-Push has some functional limitations.\r\n\r\n- Redundancy&lt;br&gt;\r\nRAID10 storage, daily off-site backups.\r\n\r\n- Webmail\r\n\r\n- Secure IMAP, POP3, SMTP.\r\n\r\n- DKIM (Open ticket for public key)\r\n\r\n- User trained bayesian filtering.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Plans:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\n(Edit: These are higher than original prices, no client will see an increase in the price of their existing service)\r\n\r\nSmall&lt;br&gt;\r\n10GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 Domain&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 Email Account&lt;br&gt;\r\n$5/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5\r\n\r\nMedium&lt;br&gt;\r\n15GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n3 Domains&lt;br&gt;\r\n10 Email Accounts per domain&lt;br&gt;\r\n$15/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=6\r\n\r\nLarge&lt;br&gt;\r\n50GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n10 Domains&lt;br&gt;\r\n30 Email Accounts per domain&lt;br&gt;\r\n$25/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3\r\n\r\nWhen I previously announced the MXroute product, it existed as a product of Catalyst Host. Today, MXroute stands on it's own two feet with myself, Ryan, and Christine as the team behind the service."}
