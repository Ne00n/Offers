You can utilize all resources to your hearts content. Reliability and uptime does not lack due to the price, all services I offer have high expectations. If you need a large VPS for something like a popular web server, high activity game server, or whatever else please consider trying it out, or any other services at ExtraVM.  \r\n  \r\n**$16/month**\r\n16GB RAM (DDR4 ECC)  \r\n2 CPU Cores (E5-1660v3, 8c/16t CPU)  \r\n100GB NVMe SSD (RAID-1)  \r\n50TB @ 500Mbps  \r\n1 IPv4, 1 IPv6  \r\nDDoS Protected ([info](https://extravm.com/billing/index.php/knowledgebase/71/How-Our-DDoS-Protection-Works.html \"info\"))  \r\nIP Management &amp; Network Firewall ([info](https://extravm.com/billing/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/80/IP-Management.html \"info\"))  \r\nRoubaix, France  \r\n[**Order Here**](https://extravm.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=241 \"Order Here\")  \r\n  \r\nExtraVM also has normal VPS services in the USA (Texas, Florida, Virginia), Canada (Montreal), Europe (France, United Kingdom), Singapore, Australia, but at the moment there are no promotions and only the 1GB RAM plans fit in LET pricing.  \r\n  \r\nAll servers have a 3 day refund period no questions asked.  \r\n  \r\nEdit: I guess technically this price is against the rules, a moderator can delete it if they feel it's necessary, but lets be real."}
