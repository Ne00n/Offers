We're currently running two active promotions this month, the details which are below, with the contest details right below the promotions:\r\n\r\n\r\n##  \ud83d\udd25 SPICY DEALS BELOW  \ud83d\udd25\r\n\r\n**Deal #1:** **Save 30% on anything, site-wide** when you pay using crypto. This includes our Shared Hosting, our new KVM plans, old plans, whatever. We accept BTC, BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETC, ETH, LTC, OXEN, THETA/TFUEL, XMR and the offer is good for life, recurring for as long as you renew the service. \r\n\r\nJust make sure you use the coupon code **SEPTCRYPTO** when you order through the \"Pay with crypto\" gateway. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Deal #2:** Get a **FREE YEAR OF SERVICE** when you pay the regular price of any annual service. Most services when paid annually are billed at the monthly rate X10, so you by default you're getting a great deal (two months free). Just contact our sales team or respond to this thread with your order ID and we'll take care of you. (Offer only available for regular price. We will not honor it combined with the above 30% coupon or any other coupon, sorry)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n##  \ud83d\udd25 CONTEST  \ud83d\udd25\r\n\r\nAfter the success of our last contest we've been eager to do something for LET again.

Your response enters you to win.\r\n\r\n**WANT TO DOUBLE YOUR CHANCE TO WIN?** Then have an active service with us, either via a new order (see promotions above) or from a previous order. PM me with your user ID / email we may have on file with you and I'll put you on the list for drawing twice, instead of once.\r\n\r\n**CONTEST TERMS**\r\nWinner is chosen at random. Contest ends in 10 days on 09/14/2021 @ 4:00PM EST and the winners will be announced after that and contacted via PM.\r\n\r\nWith account credit, you can use it as you see fit.

Sorry.\r\n- _Can I host adult content?_ - Legal adult content is fine.\r\n- _Can I host a Tor Exit?_ - Sure, just have a strict exit policy and follow our guidelines here: https://incognet.io/tor-exits\r\n- _Can I host an I2P Router?_ - Yeah, of course. We love I2P. We recommend I2P+ and here is a guide: https://incognet.io/i2p-routers (But Vanilla I2P or any variation is cool)\r\n- _What crypto do you accept?_ - BTC, BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETC, ETH, LTC, OXEN, THETA/TFUEL, XMR. We prefer BTC, XMR, and LTC but we'll take whatever of the above is convenient for you.\r\n- _Can I do ____ or use a server for ____?_ - Review our Terms: https://incognet.io/legalstuff We have zero tolerance on network abuse or spam. Just because we respect your privacy doesn't mean we let you do whatever you want.\r\n- _Hetzner_ - Yeah yeah, we know. Already seeking a new Finnish based upstream to grow our presence there. For now we'll focus on Netherlands and the USA expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**About IncogNET LLC**\r\n\r\n- Business Legal Name: IncogNET LLC ([docs](https://wyobiz.wyo.gov/Business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=229163159131103035162114075077079168168187129050 \"docs\"))\r\n- Registration Date: 04/21/2021 (I got the 'all clear' to post annual deals first)\r\n- Business Address: 30 N. Gould Street, STE 4000, Sheridan, WY 82801\r\n- Business Phone: 1-307-201-2591\r\n- Business Email: company[AT]incognet[dot]io ([Public PGP key](https://incognet.io/keys/IncogNet_company@incognet.io-0x64177C019D4F666D-pub.asc \"Public PGP key\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n**What should I choose you over anyone else?**\r\n\r\nThis is where I usually ramble on, but to put it plainly: We respect your privacy and wish to normalize privacy for the masses. We sponsor a handful of privacy related projects ( Some can be viewed here: https://incognet.io/privacyprojects ).\r\n\r\nWe don't require Personal Identifiable Information because we don't _need_ it. We're not going to write you a handwritten letter on your birthday or give you a phone call on Christmas. We don't want that information. Companies as big as Google, Facebook, T-mobile and more have all suffered breaches where your information is made public. Hosting providers, big and small, have suffered similar situations. Do you even know how many people have access to your private information? How many hosting providers do you do business with? How many employees or staff, outsourced or in-house can review your data?\r\n\r\nWith us, you can register with an alias and any email address of your choosing. Our unofficial motto is, \"We can't share what we do not know\" and that's something we think is important in this day and age. We have a strong commitment for supporting and promoting privacy and believe freedom of expression is a right that should be available to everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Company Roadmap / Future Plans**\r\n\r\n - We're currently testing a Dallas, TX based provider and hope to offer KVM Virtual Servers out of Texas as well as our Shared Hosting service by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n - Due to major IPv4 price increase via Hetzner, we're looking for a new upstream in Finland. Existing stock in Finland is limited only to larger plans as a result. We'll be seeking a DC where we can colocate owned gear directly. No ETA on this.\r\n\r\n - We'll be adding Yggdrasil Network mirroring as part of the opt-in offering to have shared hosting websites mirrored through Tor and I2P. I've done some limited testing and it works, but want to test it more.\r\n\r\n - Updates to our anycast DNS over Tor setup that the VPN network uses. This is to increase the capacity and capability of the setup.\r\n\r\n - Domain names with built-in DNS management through WHMCS. Private registration with DNS management under one roof. ETA, end of year."}
