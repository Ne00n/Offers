You might ask for any VPS to have an IPv4 for an additional 2$ one time fee.\r\n\r\nYou can nat your nodes with our internal ip's system. So you have a main vm with IPv4 (on the same node) where you can nat any ports to any number of servers. IP's are only 3$ one time + 0.4$/month. We do not provide support yet on how to do this. \r\n\r\nAbuse is defined here: https://hosterlabs.net/panel/knowledgebase/24/What-can-I-host-on-your-virtual-servers.html\r\nLong story short: Anything you wish except illegal activities such as but not limited to DDoS, SPAM, Child Pornography, etc...\r\n\r\nVPS Benchmarks: https://docs.hosterlabs.net/display/HOS/VPS+Benchmarks\r\nBy no means should you consider this as an absolute value, rather as a reference point. This can vary around 30% at any given time.\r\n\r\nNode Specifications:\r\nIntel Xeon-E 2288G ( 8 Cores / 16 threads ) Max Speed @5Ghz with overclocking.\r\n128GB DDR4 ECC 2666MHz \r\n2 x 1TB NVMe in RAID 0 ( So if one drive fails, data is lost) Nevertheless, we keep remote backups of all servers. You should not trust our backups as much, as we are seeing some failures these days on the system. We are repairing them as of now.\r\n10Gbps Downlink (Bursts) 2Gbps Uplink (Bursts)\r\n\r\nLooking Glass : Canada.lg.hosterlabs.net\r\nDocumentation: docs.hosterlabs.net\r\n\r\nExcellent connectivity to Europe and the US.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know any feedback you have."}
