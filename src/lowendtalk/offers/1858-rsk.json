However, we have been providing webhosting solutions since 2009 locally - in Dubai for young entrepreneurs and startup companies.\r\n\r\nInstead of just following the \"herd\" and offering budget VPS plans, we intended to do something more unique. We offer **free management** in our plans. Some of them come with semi-management, and others come with full management. You do not have to pay a single dollar. From installations, to configurations, to migrations - its all on us :)\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the process of developing our own **in-house panel** which will pretty much automate everything. So in the near future we hope to give clients access to do a lot of things (such as; ordering additional IPs instantly, changing plans instantly, etc.), without the need of ever contacting support - smooth and slick!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n512M Plan\r\n===============\r\n512MB RAM Guaranteed\r\n50GB HD\r\n200GB BW\r\nsemi-management\r\n$6/month\r\n\r\n\r\n[More Information/Order](http://myrsk.com/plans.html)\r\n===============\r\n\r\n**5 days money back guarantee, no BS :)**\r\n\r\nLocation: Roubaix, France (soon NL!)\r\nTest IP: 176.31.117.92\r\nTest File: http://goo.gl/oatml (10MB) http://goo.gl/hYRhG (100MB)\r\n\r\nFor queries or support please submit a ticket : http://myrsk.com/whmcs/submitticket.php\r\n\r\nWebsite : http://myrsk.com/\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nrsk"}
