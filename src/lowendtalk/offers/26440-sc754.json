I'm also pretty sure I can get ramnode to transfer it to the new owner.\r\n\r\nI have a 128mb, 10GB ssd, 500GB bandwidth ramnode openvz vps in the Netherlands. It was bought last month, but I don't need it. So I paid $13.92 which is the recurring amount. It has around 10.5 months left, I'm happy to sell it for $9. Payment by paypal please.\r\n\r\nPM me if you're interested."}
