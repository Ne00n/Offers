Our OpenVZ VPS are lightweight and simplistic, offering baremetal performance and quick reinstalls. Our KVM VPS offer BIOS level management, your own kernel and permanent VNC access. If you\u2019re unsure which you need, we recommend you select OpenVZ.\r\n\r\nWe're running multi-virtualization so we can swap your virt type at any time free of charge, we operate two methods of virtualization on one physical server so when you switch you can keep your IP address etc.\r\n\r\nPlease use the promotion code **I8XI16BL2G** to get any of these configurations for $7 per calendar month, available to new and old customers. Discounts are of course valid for the lifetime of your service with us. If you have any questions at all please do not hesitate to contact us via the email address listed at our website.\r\n\r\n512MB DDR3/ECC RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n30GB 6Gbps SATA RAID 10&lt;br&gt;\r\n500GB Bandwidth PCM @ 1000Mbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n2x Intel Xeon E3-1240v3 vCPU Cores&lt;br&gt;\r\nOpenVZ Container&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 x IPv4 Address&lt;br&gt;\r\nInstant Setup&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttp://virtual6.net/uk-vps/\r\n\r\n512MB DDR3/ECC RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n30GB 6Gbps SATA RAID 10&lt;br&gt;\r\n500GB Bandwidth PCM @ 1000Mbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n2x Intel Xeon E3-1240v3 vCPU Cores&lt;br&gt;\r\nKVM Virtual Machine&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 x IPv4 Address&lt;br&gt;\r\nInstant Setup&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttp://virtual6.net/uk-vps/\r\n\r\nWe still have the following in France too:\r\n\r\n2GB RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n100GB RAID HDD&lt;br&gt;\r\n6.25% Guaranteed vCPU (4x2.66GHz Intel Xeon cores)&lt;br&gt;\r\n5TB Monthly data transfer on 1000Mbps shared port&lt;br&gt;\r\n1x Dedicated IPV4 address&lt;br&gt;\r\nDedicated VNC/KVM console c/w virtual media support&lt;br&gt;\r\nBest effort service availability (No SLA)&lt;br&gt;\r\nAutomatic DDoS protection (No SLA)&lt;br&gt;\r\nProxmox VE 3.x control panel&lt;br&gt;\r\nKVM Full hardware virtualization&lt;br&gt;\r\nDeployed and online within one business day subject to stock!&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttp://virtual6.net/whmcs/cart.php"}
