It is ran by a small group of like-minded people who came together to make the most reliable product we could. It's true when people say \"they don't make it like they used to.\" From fibreglass cars to particle board - nothing is made to truly last anymore. We are attempting to change that. Virtua's servers are constructed from the most reliable hardware in the industry, our software is the leader in usability and stability, and our network providers are rated the best for uptime and speeds. We do everything we can to provide our customers with a reliable product. Our vision is to expand enough to have servers globally - be able to serve people in any country, but still be personable enough to be considered low end. Our first expansion will be to Los Angeles, California to serve Asia and Asia Minor better.\r\n\r\nVirtua is proud to offer a 30% off promo code to our LowEndTalk customers: WHT30\r\nExpires 5/31/14!\r\n\r\nhttps://virtuavps.com/billing/cart.php?promocode=WHT30\r\n\r\nWhois Link: http://who.is/whois/virtuavps.com\r\nIPv4 IPs used for all VPSs\r\nVirtualization Platform: OpenVZ\r\nDatacenter location: Buffalo, New York\r\nTest file: https://192.3.178.186:6767/100mb.test\r\nTest IP: 192.3.178.186\r\nNotice: PLEASE allow self-signed certificates for our test files.
