Normally the server costs 17,99\u20ac. Would give it away for ~18\u20ac. It has about 5TB Traffic\r\n(dd io-test: ~ &gt;100mb/s!)\r\n\r\nAnd one Kimsufi special Intel E6550 2x2.33 GHz, 2GB RAM, 2*500GB HDD (Software RAID), 10TB Traffic. Paid it until ~15 April. Hm, Would give it away, for also ~14\u20ac? It has about 10TB Traffic\r\n(dd io-test: ~85-100mb/s)\r\n\r\nBut important: I am not a reseller, only want to transfer the servers to another ovh account!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAmfy"}
