I provide e-mail hosting for your domain(s). I would like to announce a new feature today as well, one that I am quite proud of. Below is a list of our features.\r\n\r\n- POP, IMAP, SMTP&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Webmail&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Sieve filters&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Z-Push (works with 1 account per device)&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Control panel based on VestaCP&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Not U.S. hosted (but U.S. owned)\r\n\r\nThe new feature I would like to announce...\r\n\r\n- OwnCloud account for every e-mail account!&lt;br&gt;\r\n-- https://mxroute.com/portal (Portal link on front page of website)&lt;br&gt;\r\n-- Log in with IMAP credentials.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAll of our packages have recently been replaced to meet the requests of our users (existing users not changed). The storage has been slightly lowered from what they used to be and the limit on domains and e-mail accounts has been lifted.\r\n\r\nHere are our new packages:\r\n\r\nName: Small&lt;br&gt;\r\nStorage: 5GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDomains/E-mail Accounts: Unlimited&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=19&lt;br&gt;\r\n$10/year\r\n\r\nName: Medium&lt;br&gt;\r\nStorage: 10GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDomains/E-mail Accounts: Unlimited&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=20&lt;br&gt;\r\n$15/year\r\n\r\nName: Large&lt;br&gt;\r\nStorage: 15GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDomains/E-mail Accounts: Unlimited&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=21&lt;br&gt;\r\n$20/year\r\n\r\nThere are no active promo codes that apply to these packages. They are priced to be inexpensive, to such a degree that a discount is not appropriate."}
