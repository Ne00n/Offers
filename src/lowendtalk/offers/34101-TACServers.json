We have yet to stray from this mission. We strive to provide the highest level of technical service possible, and will work with you to establish a stable online presence. We own all our own hardware, we do not have outstanding debts, and are here for the long term.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; TACServers bases itself on the pride and ethics we believe is needed to run any type of hosting company. We believe that every server should be maintained at an acceptable load level, and we strive to never oversell our resources. Our OpenVZ nodes are under-allocated, leaving 10-14GB of RAM for caching the FS, and thus, VPS files. Our team is based out of the United States and have years of networking and Linux/Windows experience!\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; TACServers' goal is to make you, the customer, happy. We are proud to call all our customers business partners. Our mission statement: Anything we can do to make you happy, makes us happy! We grow as you grow, and without YOU: the client, we would have nothing to do! Many people neglect the importance of the customer, but not TACServers.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Here's our two VPS plans for sale today!\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     OpenVZ Virtualization,\r\n&gt;     256 MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n&gt;     256 MB vSwap\r\n&gt;     2 vCPU Cores\r\n&gt;     30 GB RAID Disk Space\r\n&gt;     150 GB Bandwidth\r\n&gt;     100 Mbps Port Speed\r\n&gt;     1 IPv4 Address\r\n&gt;     2 IPv6 Addresses\r\n&gt;     SolusVM VPS Control Panel\r\n&gt;     Location: Denver, CO\r\n&gt;     US Based Support\r\n&gt;     Templates: CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu 14.04 (32bit + 64bit versions)\r\n&gt;     $4.00 per month (Quarterly $10.00) &lt;&lt;&lt; $2.00 / $5.00 With Promo TACLET\r\n&gt;     Order Here: [OVZ1](https://manage.tacservers.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     OpenVZ Virtualization,\r\n&gt;     512 MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n&gt;     512 MB vSwap\r\n&gt;     2 vCPU Cores\r\n&gt;     40 GB RAID Disk Space\r\n&gt;     200 GB Bandwidth\r\n&gt;     100 Mbps Port Speed\r\n&gt;     1 IPv4 Address\r\n&gt;     2 IPv6 Addresses\r\n&gt;     SolusVM VPS Control Panel\r\n&gt;     Location: Denver, CO\r\n&gt;     US Based Support\r\n&gt;     Templates: CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu 14.04 (32bit + 64bit versions)\r\n&gt;     $7.00 per month (Quarterly $17.00) &lt;&lt;&lt; $3.50 / $8.50 With Promo TACLET\r\n&gt;     Order Here: [OVZ2](https://manage.tacservers.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Main Site:\r\n&gt; http://www.tacservers.net/\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Test, 100Mbit VPS:\r\n&gt; http://lg.den.tacservers.net/\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Test IPv6:\r\n&gt; 2001:470:4b:255:1111:1111:5837:a4a1\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Test IPv4:\r\n&gt; 64.78.145.92\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ASN:\r\n&gt; http://bgp.he.net/AS13649\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Payment Methods:\r\n&gt; PayPal\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Limited availibility on this Promo code!
