Each of them was paid until 01.10.2014 (3 months remaining), and has the following configuration\r\n\r\n    6GB RAM\r\n    6GB vSwap\r\n    8 vCPU Cores\r\n    75GB Disk space\r\n    2000GB Bandwidth\r\n    1Gbps uplink\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    OpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n\r\nNow I would like to keep only 2 for next year. So I want to let 2 of them go.\r\n\r\nWith only **$40** paid to my PayPal as a gift (or $43 as normal transaction with ~$3 will go to PayPal) you will have **2 VPS** with 3 months remaining\r\n\r\nThe most interesting for this offer is you can renew each of them at **only $44** with WeLoveServers.\r\n\r\nTypical questions:\r\n\r\n- Why $43 instead of $22.2 (2 x 3 months x $44/12)?\r\n- What is the price if I want only 1 of them? $25 to my Paypal (or $26.5 with PayPal as a Gift)\r\n\r\nPlease see the answers in previous threads\r\n\r\n- http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/27923/6-gb-ram-6gb-swap-8-vcpu-75-gb-ssd-cached-for-only-3-7-from-oct-2014#latest\r\n- http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/25352/17-months-6-gb-ram-6gb-swap-8-vcpu-75-gb-ssd-cached-with-only-94\r\n"}
