My answer is yes but will be in BF and will be limited quantity.\r\nDo you offer custom iso ? my answer : for the moment no but if you search in my other threads some customer do this via novnc console.\r\nDo you offer ipv6 ? my answer ... for the moment no and is not a priority for hostsolutions to implement this in the near future .\r\nIs the offer recurring ? my answer is : i am not adept to up the price so almost sure yes is recurring except some external terms , like electrical cost , ip cost but all this we will see past 3 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nAditional ip cost ? 1 eur/mo.\r\n\r\nThe port speed is shared so if you do all day/night traffic try to stay under 200mbps.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Delivery time** for the first 20 orders is estimated 2 hours. The rest one monday/tuesday .\r\n\r\nAny question related to this offer please post here , other comments if is not related please respect this thread.\r\n\r\nThanks , \r\nMarius\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
