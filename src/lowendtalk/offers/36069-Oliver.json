If you've been holding off Australian services due to relatively small data allowances this might change your mind.\r\n\r\n- $20 USD quarterly\r\n- OpenVZ VPS\r\n- 256MB RAM\r\n- 15GB HDD\r\n- 1 CPU Core (E3-1270 v3)\r\n- 500GB Data (huge allocation in Australia for this price!)\r\n- 1 IPv4, 1 IPv6\r\n\r\nThere's a looking glass up temporarily here: http://168.1.71.36/lg/\r\n\r\nOrder Link:\r\nhttps://secure.ransomit.com.au/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=109\r\n\r\nNote that this offer is limited in quantity and I may not renew it depending on uptake when I launch officially so get in quick! I think everyone knows the SoftLayer network (AS36351) has a good reputation and their connectivity into Asia via the Sydney-Japan link is very good. :-)"}
