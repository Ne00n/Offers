Yes disk is low but it's 6x450GB SAS so you get alot of iops out of this!\r\n\r\nNode specs:\r\nDual AMD 2.1Ghz (32 Cores)\r\n128GB RAM\r\n6x450GB SAS RAID 10\r\n1GBit port\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;16 Cores\r\n1024MB RAM\r\n10GB HD\r\n500GB BW\r\nBlazing fast SAS storage\r\n1 IPv4 \r\nWindows + Linux available \r\nOrder https://nodedeploy.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=17\r\n100mbit bw\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nWith the dedicated ram, SAS disk drives and higher CPU availability, it makes this plan perfect for running minecraft servers.\r\n\r\nWhat we plan on doing:\r\nWe plan  to add 'slower' storage so you can get more storage capacity, 50 for $2.50 extra. This is a future development we'll likely roll out soon. So you'll have 10GB SAS w/ 50GB Sata raid 10 thoughts?"}
