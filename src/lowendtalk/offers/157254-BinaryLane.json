Since then we have added Sydney and Melbourne, and now its Perth's turn.\r\n\r\nWe have a bespoke control panel with a wide variety of features, some of the more interesting ones are:\r\n\r\n * external firewall with web-interface\r\n * good IPv6 support, including a /56 per server and PTR nameserver delegation\r\n * \"virtual private cloud\" (vxlan) for inter-server communication\r\n * upload/download disk backups\r\n * variety of pre-built distributions or BYO ISO\r\n * load-balancer as-a-service\r\n * OpenStack Compute API support\r\n\r\nWe have a LG here: https://per-lg.binarylane.cloud/\r\n\r\n--\r\nhttps://www.binarylane.com.au/"}
