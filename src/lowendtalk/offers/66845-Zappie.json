So was wondering if anyone based in the area is wanting pick it up.\r\n\r\n    Pick Up Address:\r\n    Dacentec\r\n    801 Main St. N.W.\r\n    Lenoir, N.C. 28645\r\n\r\n    Server Specs:\r\n    Model: HP Proliant (1U)\r\n    CPU: 2XL5420\r\n    RAM: 16GB\r\n    Drives: 4 x 146GB SAS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo anyone in the area that wants the server for free, let me know. (send me a PM, first come first served) \r\n\r\nYou will need to have an account registered with dacentec for the transfer of ownership. \r\n\r\nNote: to de-rack the server dacentec does charge $50 fee IIRC\r\n"}
