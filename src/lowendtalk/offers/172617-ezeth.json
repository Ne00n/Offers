Your order will be rejected and we will not approve this manually.**\r\n\r\nHello everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm happy to announce the launch of our brand [boomer.host](https://boomer.host/ \"boomer.host\")\r\n\r\nWhat makes us different from the rest?\r\n\r\nWe have been around ever since 2018. The reason why it's so cheap is because we use our premium brands discontinued server hardware. We save both time and money doing this since we don't have to beat it with a bat and then throw it in the bin.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy VPS plan 2 or higher we will ship a free boomer sticker to you (the logo) as long as you live in the US. This is quite high quality, we hired someone to draw it, color it etc based on the famous boomer from the best youtube channel ever, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3TUCGI-7rSjvHsE4ONXRww.\r\n\r\nThe server location is in **Dallas Texas**. It's our discontinued server with new SSDs. We use **Data Ideas as our colocation**.\r\n\r\nHere is our launch offer. \r\n\r\nBoomer VPS\r\n1GB RAM\r\n5GB SSD disk space\r\n3600GB Bandwidth\r\n1 CPU\r\nDedicated IPv4 &amp; IPv6\r\n_US$7.95/yr (about $0.66/month)_\r\n[Order now](https://my.boomer.host/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=4&amp;product=1 \"Order now\")\r\n\r\nZoomer VPS\r\n2GB RAM\r\n10GB SSD disk space\r\n7200GB Bandwidth\r\n2 CPU\r\nDedicated IPv4 &amp; IPv6\r\nFree Boomer sticker shipped to you (US only) **Comment your OrderID and we'll ship it**\r\n_US$12.95/yr (about $1.08/month)_\r\n[Order now](https://my.boomer.host/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=4&amp;product=2 \"Order now\")\r\n\r\nCoomer VPS\r\n4GB RAM\r\n15GB SSD disk space\r\n10000GB Bandwidth\r\n2 CPU\r\nDedicated IPv4 &amp; IPv6\r\nFree Boomer sticker shipped to you (US only)) **Comment your OrderID and we'll ship it**\r\n_US$18.95/yr (about $1.58/month)_\r\n[Order now](https://my.boomer.host/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=4&amp;product=3 \"Order now\")\r\n\r\nPing Test:\r\n64.112.124.124\r\n2001:550:3402:32:0000:0000:0039:3d94\r\n\r\nSetup Time - 1 hour. Need to manually verify order\r\n\r\nAlmost the general rules as our friend, @randvegeta  over at [Millenial.Host](https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/171682/millenial-host-launch/p1 \"Millenial.Host\") applies. No abuse of resources or any kind of abuse. Fair usage on CPU. Rule of thumb is, if it's ilegal, attract DDoS, then it's **NOT okay**! Abusers will be terminated without notice or refund.\r\n\r\nBecause our pricing is so cheap we will not offer any money back should you change your mind.\r\n\r\nSMTP and all mailing ports are also blocked permanently\r\n\r\nAny questions, please feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nPort Speed: 100MBit\r\n\r\nYou can choose Ubuntu 20.04 or Centos 7. We utilize OpenVZ 7"}
