I'm looking for someone to fill a 10AM-6PM GMT -7 M-F position. You'd be working with our head of support, Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe perfect candidate would have:\r\n\r\n- Experience with cPanel and Directadmin. While we're not offering Buyshared plans anymore, Directadmin is a big part of our offerings.\r\n- A good handling on trouble shooting and debugging. I need someone that can work at a problem, even if it means looking for ideas on stackoverflow.\r\n- A good grasp of the english language. Other languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, &amp; Chinese, would be a huge positive.\r\n- Strong experience with Linux is a must. Windows is a nice plus as well.\r\n- A good understanding of networking &amp; routing. You can read an MTR, you've setup tunnels (GRE, WG, OVPN, things like that. If you've setup your own BGP routing, OSPF, static routing, that'd be a huge win.\r\n\r\nPlease PM me here with your resumes or just to talk things over.\r\n\r\nWage &amp; perks to be negotiated in private. Please, no outsourcing teams. You must work exclusively for us. \r\n\r\nFrancisco"}
