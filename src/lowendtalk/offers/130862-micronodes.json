Upon request, we can assist our customers in setting up gameservers on their VPS\u2019s. Our VPS\u2019s support a wide range of Operating Systems such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, &amp; even Windows Server (Unlicensed - Bring Your Own License). Our goal is to provide fast, secure, and high quality VPS's at an affordable rate. We utilize the Wow-Rack Datacenter to host our nodes in Seattle, Washington. We have grown to now provide premium service. We are your affordable and sustainable hosting solution.\r\n  \r\n  **Website: https://micronodes.net**\r\n \r\n  **100 MB Test File: https://micronodes.net/testfile/100MB.zip**\r\n\r\n  **100 MB Test File: http://lg.micronodes.net**\r\n \r\n  **Test IP:** 104.192.101.3\r\n\r\n  \r\n  **Node Specs:**\r\n  \r\n  \u2022Dual Intel Xeon L5640s (6 cores/12 threads each CPU)&gt;\r\n \r\n  \u202264GB DDR3 ECC RAM\r\n \r\n  \u20224x 1TB RAID 10 Array of Premium Western Digital/Hitachi HDDs\r\n \r\n  \u20221Gbps Network \r\n  \r\n  All VPS's come with 20Gbps DDoS Protection with an L7 filter to keep your server safe and online.\r\n \r\n  **Plans and Pricing (50% off recurring using promo code bfvps50, Offers valid through Mon. 11/27/2017):**\r\n\r\n **\u2022 128MB RAM**\r\n  \r\n  -1024MB Swap\r\n  \r\n  -1x vCPU\r\n  \r\n  -5GB HDD space\r\n  \r\n  -150GB transfer\r\n  \r\n  -1Gbps Network \r\n  \r\n  -1x IPv4\r\n  \r\n  -KVM/Virtualizer\r\n  \r\n  -$1.80/monthly with promo code bfvps50\r\n  \r\n  -Order link (https://client.micronodes.net/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=0)\r\n  \r\n **\u2022 256MB RAM**\r\n  \r\n  -1024MB Swap\r\n  \r\n  -1x vCPU\r\n  \r\n  -8GB HDD space\r\n  \r\n  -250GB transfer\r\n  \r\n  -1Gbps Network \r\n  \r\n  -1x IPv4\r\n  \r\n  -KVM/Virtualizer\r\n  \r\n  -$2.14/monthly with promo code bfvps50\r\n  \r\n  -Order link (https://client.micronodes.net/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=1)\r\n  \r\n  **\u2022 512MB RAM**\r\n  \r\n  -1024MB Swap\r\n  \r\n  -1x vCPU\r\n  \r\n  -20GB HDD space\r\n  \r\n  -500GB transfer\r\n  \r\n  -1Gbps Network \r\n  \r\n  -1x IPv4\r\n  \r\n  -KVM/Virtualizer\r\n  \r\n  -$3.00/monthly with promo code bfvps50 \r\n  \r\n  -Order link (http://client.micronodes.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3)\r\n  \r\n  **\u2022 1024MB RAM**\r\n  \r\n  -1024MB Swap\r\n  \r\n  -2x vCPU\r\n  \r\n  -50GB HDD space\r\n  \r\n  -1.5TB transfer\r\n  \r\n  -10Gbps uplink\r\n  \r\n  -1x IPv4\r\n  \r\n  -KVM/Virtualizer\r\n  \r\n  -$4.50/monthly with promo code bfvps50\r\n  \r\n  Order link (http://client.micronodes.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Each additional IPV4 is **NOW** $1.00/IP.
