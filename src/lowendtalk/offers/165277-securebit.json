RIPE NCC is responsible for the allocation and assignment of Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) and IP addresses in Europe. As LIR (Local Internet Registry), we offer them at attractive conditions.\r\n\r\nWe are the only provider to offer our customers the possibility to choose the geolocation of the superordinate subnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Today we want to offer you a small budget IPv6 Prefix**:\r\n&gt; **IPv6 Subnet /44 - CHF 15.00/anually ($15.77/anually) - [Order now](https://www.securebit.ch/order?id=a27)**\r\n&gt; - Geolocation for Assigment\r\n&gt; - Geolocation for superordinate subnet (AU, DE, EU, LI, VA)\r\n&gt; - Assignet to your RIPE ORG Object\r\n&gt; - You can create Sub-Allocations, Routes and Domains (PTR)\r\n&gt; - Webinterface (Securebit Cloud Manager)\r\n\r\n[View all Offers and more Details](https://www.securebit.ch/internet/resources/ipv6)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes sense, because there are providers and databases which obtain the location from the databases of the RIR (Regional Internet Registry) instead of reading the location data from the Whois.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![](https://cdn.4b42.com/images/website/InternetResourcesGeolocation.png \"\")\r\n[Details](https://www.securebit.ch/internet/resources/ipv6)\r\n\r\nOur customers also like to use Europe for their Anycast DNS and CDN networks. Of course, you can additionally store or adapt the country of your subnetworks in the RIPE database.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find more Informations about Internet Resouces (ASN and IP-Prefixes) here:\r\nhttps://www.securebit.ch/internet/resources\r\nAnd about our Tunnel here:\r\nhttps://www.securebit.ch/internet/tunnel\r\n\r\n\r\n**Find out more about Securebit AG and our offers:**\r\n\r\n * [Legal informations](https://www.securebit.ch/about/legal)\r\n\r\n * [Privacy](https://www.securebit.ch/about/privacy)\r\n\r\n * [Technology](https://www.securebit.ch/about/technology)\r\n\r\n * [Internet Resources (ASN, IPv4 and IPv6)](https://www.securebit.ch/internet/resources)\r\n\r\n * [Virtual Servers](https://www.securebit.ch/server/virtual) (you can connect to multiple Internet Exchanges)\r\n"}
