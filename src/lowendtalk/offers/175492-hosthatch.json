These are meant to be used for mass storage, and not I/O intensive tasks.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nImportant notes:\r\n\r\n- All orders are final and cannot be changed or refunded. We have limited capacity available. Please only buy if you are absolutely sure that you would like to use the server.\r\n- An order is considered final once it is paid for. There is no 'reservation' system.\r\n- We will cancel all unpaid orders after 60 minutes of them being unpaid. If you order something, do not pay for it, and it goes out of stock, we will not be able to offer it to you again.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe might offer some flash deals on Monday, however this isn't a promise. We have very limited capacity available this time around.\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that the pricing might look more expensive than the last year. This is to account for the newer hardware and much higher IP costs. This pricing also allows us to make a slightly healthier profit to offer you a better service and support in the future.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nThank you everyone! :)"}
