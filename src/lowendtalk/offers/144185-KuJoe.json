If you're local and willing to go pick it up it's yours. Just reply or PM me that you want it and I'll coordinate with the data center for you to go pick it up.  \r\n\r\n**_LOCAL ONLY! No hardware will be shipped or delivered to you so if you cannot physically go to the data center to retrieve the server please do not reply._**  \r\n\r\nServer is a really old 2U Dell PowerEdge 2950 with 2x X5355 CPUs, 16GB of DDR2 RAM, a PERC6 RAID controller, DRAC5, 2 PSUs, and 6x 146GB SAS drives."}
