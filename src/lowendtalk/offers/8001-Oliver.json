I've gone crazy!\r\n\r\nRansom IT is offering the following special for Valentine's Day (though it'll be available as long as stock lasts). We're calling it: The Barry White KVM VPS.\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://www.ransomit.com.au/barry_white.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\r\nKVM/Solus\r\n512MB RAM\r\n20GB of Disk Space\r\n&lt;strong&gt;40GB of inbound data transfer\r\n100GB of outbound data transfer&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 / 10 IPv6\r\nShared 100mbit port\r\n2 CPU Cores\r\nRange of ISOs and templates available\r\nPay in USD or AUD or Euro\r\nTrace check: 119.252.16.201\r\n\r\nWe have over 20 OS templates available and 10 different templates which are all ready to go. By default we don't mount or install an OS so you will need to do this yourself via VNC. The best local mirror for &lt;a href=\"http://mirror.colocity.com/centos/\"&gt;CentOS is here&lt;/a&gt; and for almost every other distribution/OS we recommend using a mirror from another local provider &lt;a href=\"http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nMake sure you fill in the order form correctly; otherwise I just won't feel the love!\r\n\r\nLinks to order at the usual LEB price of $7 per month (but you have to pay quarterly). You can pay in any of the following three currencies.\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://secure.ransomit.com.au/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=61&amp;currency=1\"&gt;Pay in USD&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://secure.ransomit.com.au/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=61&amp;currency=2\"&gt;Pay in AUD&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://secure.ransomit.com.au/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=61&amp;currency=3\"&gt;Pay in Euro&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nBy the way for any potential customers in Asia please remember that connectivity now is heavily degraded due to the cable cut between Perth and Singapore. This will improve when it is repaired (hopefully before the end of the month)."}
