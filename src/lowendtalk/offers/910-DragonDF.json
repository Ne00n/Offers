But I think this time will not be enough.\r\nSo, I am thinking about to know if there is another way to test it (I will not use it for real clients) to learn how to setup.\r\n\r\nThe best price I saw is around $15 for a Cpanel license.\r\n\r\nAnother doubt: when you pay for Cpanel, is there any Addon for free (like Softaculous) or I need to pay (/month) for it, too?\r\n\r\nHow can I be safe about attacks?\r\nDo I need to configure a firewall (for prevent DDOS attacks) and what do you recomend?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!"}
