Therefore we keep responding on our most bought products which tend to be low-end. So we have decided to go full-on low-end this time. This servers are not bad, they perform just average. No incredible downloads/uploads or bandwidth. Everything is just average (unlike our other products). \r\n\r\nSo who is this server useful for?\r\n1. Looking for a low end server.\r\n2. Looking for a lot of IP's.\r\n3. Looking for raw RAM/CPU.\r\n4. Idlers\r\n5. Websites of mid-low traffic.\r\n6. Looking for windows by bringing own license.\r\n\r\nWho is this server not useful for?\r\n5. People who use a lot of bandwidth\r\n6. People who receive a lot of DDoS\r\n7.
