These are the rules for posting in this category:\r\n\r\n* Members must have **5 posts** and have been registered for **7 days** to be allowed to post in this forum.\r\n* You must have a website with a proper ordering system. \"Email me to get this deal\" does not count.\r\n* **VPS offers only**. No shared hosting, cloud hosting or other products where the actual users do not get root or Administrator account.\r\n* **Low End offers only**. Currently a price point must be met\r\n  * **USD$7/month** recurring on monthly billing, with no setup fee, or\r\n  * **USD$60/year** recurring on annual billing, with no setup fee, if the provider has been in business for more than a year.\r\n  * For currency other than USD, use the foreign exchange on the day of posting to verify the cost fits the requirement.\r\n  * Do not list packages that do not pass the pricing test, even if you have one or more that do.\r\n* **Maximum 1 post per provider per 14 days**. More frequent than that would be regarded as spams and posts will be removed.\r\n\r\n* **Using a nulled WHMCS** grants you a lifetime ban on LowEndBox and LowEndTalk.\r\n\r\n* Providers _**under 12 months old**_ need to display valid Public WHOIS information on their domain.\r\n\r\n* Please be informative in your offers. Please list out basic specifications (amount of memory, storage space, monthly data/bandwidth and port speed), virtualization method (Xen, OpenVZ, KVM, etc), data center location and a test IP would be ideal.\r\n\r\nDiscussion threads that do not conform to the rules will be deleted, and repeating offenders will have account suspended."}
