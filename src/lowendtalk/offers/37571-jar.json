Although we accomodate clients of all types, we cater most to people who already understand how e-mail works. Our goals are simple:\r\n\r\n- Budget prices\r\n- Premium quality\r\n- Reasonable support\r\n\r\nWe take a business model that we know works for the rest of the hosting industry and apply it to e-mail hosting. E-mail hosting is a market that is all too often known for high prices, low resources. Despite being subject to the same market conditions as the VPS market, it is still often over priced.\r\n\r\nSo what's the catch? Your support requests may take up to 24 hours to receive a response. If there is a service outage, this is not relevant. These will receive instant action, though resolutions are not always instant. Basically I expect you to know how to setup Outlook, but if you don't I will help you, and that help may not be instant.\r\n\r\nWe make no illusions about our service. We know that companies charge a lot more and offer a lot less uptime and redundancy. We provide a premium service by the following:\r\n\r\n- DDOS protection\r\n- Redunant front end routing points\r\n- Secondary relay to hold incoming mail in the event of outage\r\n- RAID10 storage with daily off-site backups\r\n\r\nNow for the offers. I have a promo code for you below:\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;MX10&lt;/b&gt; - 10% off recurring for life.\r\n\r\n(The monthly plans include an unbranded option for resellers. These currently lack a secondary relay server.)\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Yearly Plans:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nSmall&lt;br&gt;\r\n10GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 Domain&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 Email Account&lt;br&gt;\r\n$5/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5\r\n\r\nMedium&lt;br&gt;\r\n15GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n3 Domains&lt;br&gt;\r\n10 Email Accounts per domain&lt;br&gt;\r\n$15/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=6\r\n\r\nLarge&lt;br&gt;\r\n50GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n10 Domains&lt;br&gt;\r\n30 Email Accounts per domain&lt;br&gt;\r\n$25/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Monthly Plans:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nMX350&lt;br&gt;\r\n20GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnlimited Domains&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnlimited Accounts&lt;br&gt;\r\n$3.50/m&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=10&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnbranded: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=15\r\n\r\nMX500&lt;br&gt;\r\n40GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnlimited Domains&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnlimited Accounts&lt;br&gt;\r\n$5.00/m&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=11&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnbranded: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=16\r\n\r\nMX700&lt;br&gt;\r\n75GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnlimited Domains&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnlimited Accounts&lt;br&gt;\r\n$7.00/m&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=12&lt;br&gt;\r\nUnbranded: https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=17"}
