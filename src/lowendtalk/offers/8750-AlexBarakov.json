Currently, requests for additional resources (Including the filtered IPs) are handled manually, through opening a ticket, as I am not yet used to WHMCS's automatic upgrades option and TBH, not absolutely sure how to get it to automatically asign IPs from different IP block. The protection is remote (GRE tunneled to our nodes) and would filter up to 10gbps of incomming DDoS, however no guarantees or SLA is provided for this at this point, once the attack exceeds the protection we can offer, the IP will get automatically nullrouted, untill the attack is stoped. It consists of network-level protection, some custom rules requested by me and a bit of software-level protection, tweaked by me. We have a long way to walk, however even at this point - it successfully passed my tests and would be enough to protect yourself from script-kiddies :)\r\n\r\nI'm in the final stages of testing out the free FTP space that we are about to provide to our clients and the free DNS services, hopefully I will finally be ready to roll them out this workweek. Of course - for free for our users.\r\n\r\nThird - the new website is finally online with some minor resource upgrades for our normal plans. Any feedback is welcome on that! A special page for LEB/LET offer is also live on our website now: http://liquid-solutions.biz/leb.html\r\n\r\nFourth - I've started preparing a small wiki for our clients, which will include some of the most common questions and topycs for setting up different software, however got no ETA on finishing this.\r\n\r\n**Some Test IPs:**\r\nLenoir, North Carolina: 199.241.190.99 @ DaCentec\r\nSeattle, Washington: 198.23.149.3 @ ColoCrossing\r\nLos Angeles, California: 198.23.250.135 @ ColoCrossing\r\n\r\nAlexander"}
