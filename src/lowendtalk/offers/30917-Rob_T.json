This new system, developed exclusively for Versaweb, actively monitors our entire network for DoS attacks.

Only traffic destined for the IP being attacked is dropped, thereby protecting the rest of our network.\r\n\r\nFor users that need a greater level of protection, we also offer Enterprise DoS Protection + Mitigation.
