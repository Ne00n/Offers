Their VPS offers are not lowend in any way (actually rather expensive).  That's why TechieVPS' offers were such a deal.\r\n\r\n600Mb/1.2GB Burst, 10GB HDD with 1TB  - $5.95/mo\r\n\r\nThey are going to honor that under their VPS.net brand and likely will be free upgraded to a larger common plan (i.e 752MB RAM, 20GB HDD, 2TB) which is a $38/mo plan.   Their least costly plan is $20 a month, so these should prove to be a good value to someone familiar with VPS.net.\r\n\r\nIf interested contact me via private message to discuss."}
