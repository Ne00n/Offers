We aim to offer your the most features at the lowest price possible. With multiple offsite backup locations, CloudFlare, Softaculous and Nginx+Varnish, and now OpenVZ and KVM VPS, we feel we are almost there but if you have any suggestions to a feature we should add to our lineup please let us know!\r\n\r\nStandard **Features**&lt;br&gt;\r\n- SolusVM Powered&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Native IPv6&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Powerful Intel E5 CPU's&lt;br&gt;\r\n- SSD-Caching&lt;br&gt;\r\n- NO BS!&lt;br&gt;\r\n- DDoS Protection (Provided for free via OVH PRO DDoS protection, ticket to have this enabled full time or on demand.)\r\n\r\n**Recent Changes**&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Created a script to set up networking when installing from an ISO. Can be found in KB!&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Added CentOS 7 ISO.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Added CentOS 5 x86 / x86_64 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x86 / x86_64 templates.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- All new VM's will come with an internal IP address!  Existing clients please ticket for an internal IP address.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Weekly backups are being reconsidered at this time due to the issues experienced with the last node failure in NC.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Nightly backups have been changed to weekly due to more than half of the nodes taking longer than 24 hours to complete the backup process.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- With the help of a few members here I have made changes to all of the KVM templates provided.  They will now auto-configure the network connection of your Canadian KVM VPS.  Provision and go!
