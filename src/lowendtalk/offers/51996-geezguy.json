And since they have now changed their coupon policy so the credits expire after a year, I want to sell it as I probably won't use it before the expiry date.\r\nThe account has $103 credit on it which will expire on March 2016. The account is active and you can create droplets without needing to add a credit card or pay with paypal (as I have already done so).\r\nI'm asking for $35 on paypal (and paypal only!) for it, or the best offer if there are more people interested."}
