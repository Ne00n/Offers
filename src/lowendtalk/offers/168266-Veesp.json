So, here you go!\r\n\r\nIf you are a new client, use the promo code **50BF2020** to get **50% off** on the first payment for all VPS (yes, including SSD, and even Windows-based servers!) &amp; dedicated server plans!\r\n\r\nThe discount is valid for all billing cycles and **multiplies with our regular discounts**.

Use the code **25BF2020** to get a **25% discount** on the first payment for any VPS or dedicated server, no limit on the number of uses until the promotion ends or servers sold out! \ud83d\ude32\r\n\r\n**[&gt; Check out our powerful VPS &lt;](https://veesp.com/products/vps/?utm_source=lowendtalk&amp;utm_medium=topic&amp;utm_campaign=bf2020 \"Check out our powerful VPS\")**\r\n\r\n**[&gt; And reliable dedicated servers &lt;](https://veesp.com/products/dedicated-servers/?utm_source=lowendtalk&amp;utm_medium=topic&amp;utm_campaign=bf2020 \"And reliable dedicated servers\")**\r\n\r\nFor those of you who don't know, recently we launched a new VPS location in the European Union - Riga, Latvia.
