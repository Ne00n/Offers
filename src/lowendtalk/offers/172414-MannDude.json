The coupon code, \"CRYPTOMONTH\" works on all Shared Hosting, Ad-Block VPN and KVM VPS plans. Deal is recurring and for the life of your product/service. Promotion ends July 31st, 2021.\r\n\r\nWe accept: BTC, BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETC, ETH, LTC, OXEN, THETA/TFUEL, &amp; XMR.\r\n\r\nAlthough we also accept PayPal/Card, this promotion is payments made via crypto only. Contact us if you're interested in services but are unable to order via crypto and prefer traditional methods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following plans are located in Helsinki, Finland with Hetzner. We're working on additional locations and weighing options for expansion in other privacy friendly locations.\r\n\r\nAll servers in are powered by AMD Ryzen CPU's and either have SSD or NVMe storage. Orders for the next couple of days will likely be provisioned on an SSD node, however the one coming after is NVMe.

Promotion applies to all plans. See all of our plans here: https://incognet.io/vps\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOur **Ad and Bullshit Blocking VPN Service** is also available at 50% off. We operate our own anycast \"DNS Over Tor\" network, which is where we filter out all the \"BS\" like ads, trackers, telemetry gatherers and other known malicious domains from resolving over our VPN network.\r\n\r\nThis is a barebones service. You get an OpenVPN configuration file for each location you select. We suggest that you use the _official_ OpenVPN apps for your desktop, server, or mobile devices.\r\n\r\nThere is no tracking, no logging, no data caps. If you order the \"Pick 3\" plan, you can use one configuration file on your phone, another on your desktop, and give one to a friend and all be connected at the same time.\r\n\r\n        VPN PLANS INCLUDE\r\n        No Data Caps\r\n        No Logging\r\n        DNS over Tor\r\n        Blocks Advertisements\r\n        Blocks Web Trackers\r\n        Blocks Malware\r\n        Multiple VPN Locations\r\n        Crypto Accepted\r\n        No Personal Details Required\r\n        OpenVPN protocol (WireGuard soon!)\r\n        -----------\r\n        Pricing:\r\n        -----------\r\n        Choose 1 location: Was $2/mo, now $1/mo.\r\n        Choose 3 locations: Was $4/mo, now $2/mo.\r\n        Choose 5 locations: Was $6/mo, now $3/mo.\r\n\r\n**Order Now:** **[Choose 1 Location](https://portal.incognet.io/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=24 \"Choose 1 Location\")** or **[Choose 3 Locations](https://portal.incognet.io/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=13 \"Choose 3 Locations\")** or **[Choose 5 Locations](https://portal.incognet.io/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=12 \"Choose 5 Locations\")**.\r\n\r\nNOTE: That VPN orders are manually setup. After payment clears, it could be 0 - 12 hours before I get you setup. Once setup, you'll be notified via email/ticket and will have a configuration file available from your client portal for each of the locations that you choose.\r\n\r\nIf you select the same location more than once when ordering, you will receive however many configurations for that location that you choose. IE: Order the \"Pick 3\" plan and choose 2 New York and 1 Luxembourg = You'll receive 2 separate New York configuration files and 1 Luxembourg configuration file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any questions or concerns."}
