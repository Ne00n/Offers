They're about ready to expire, registered with GoDaddy and I'm not going to use them.\r\n\r\nThey're free for the taking.  I make this offer with the assumption that I can transfer them to another GoDaddy client.  If I can't, I'm just going to let them expire.\r\n\r\nSTUDENT-LOAN-FAQ.INFO   That expires on Jan 20th.\r\n\r\nCAR-REMOTE-STARTERS.COM That expires on Feb 5th."}
