The job would be easy - maybe one trip to the data center (The Westin) per week to rack a server or two. You would also need to be on call to replace failed hardware within a short period of time (rare, but it does happen). Pay would probably be per trip, averaging out to a few hundred dollars per month.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at nick[at]ramnode.com if you are interested."}
