The current promotions do not apply to London, frankly, it is hard enough to keep ahead of the demand as it is in London but we have identified some hardware that can be used for sales only so I am working on that today (and 1001 other things) so if I have the physical capacity I will do a London promotion before the sales are over.\r\n\r\n2. Sales apply to plans with 1 GB Ram or more. Sales and coupons do not apply to existing products, sorry but check the history behind the Black Friday sales, this was never how it worked :) (I will try to do something for existing customers that gives them some of the action this weekend though so don't get too angry).\r\n\r\n3. There are no refunds on Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional sales, if you want to buy please be sure you really want to buy, the terms are available to you before you commit to them, they only take 5 minutes to scan read.\r\n\r\n4. Benchmarks over the next week will be stupid, everyone will be doing it and it is a shared resource environment at the end of the day, we only use enterprise-grade kit, please be considerate when testing over the next week.\r\n\r\n5. Yes China and Brazil are still blocked due to the volume of abuse and chargebacks, sorry I cannot make any exceptions, work is underway to lift this restriction with alternative payment gateways.\r\n\r\n6. Support may be slower than usual for the next few days as such Direct admin requests will be done on a best efforts basis as they are manually generated, (It might take us a day or 2 to catch up on these requests)\r\n\r\n7. It is impossible to know how the sales will go so we may adapt based on requirements as we go when they are sold out, they are gone, see you next year, I understand why you might ask for just 1 more, but that will be the 50th request for just 1 more :)\r\n"}
