Fellow members made this brand what it is today. All your patronage is sincerely appreciated.\r\n\r\nTo give back to the community and celebrate our birthday, we have decided to deploy some E3 nodes in our flagship datacenter provider, Incero in Dallas, TX and make a crazy sale.\r\n\r\nWe love you guys!\r\n\r\n**The Plan Specs:**\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nOpenVZ Container Virtualization\r\n1 vCPU (E3 1230v2)\r\n512MB Memory\r\n256MB vSwap\r\n7GB Pure SSD Space (RAID1)\r\n1 IP Address (IPv6 to be added this week)\r\n2TB Traffic\r\n1Gbit Port speed\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n**The Order Link**\r\n\r\nhttps://vpsdime.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=43\r\n\r\n**The Catch**\r\n\r\nMail ports are blocked.
