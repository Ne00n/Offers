If you're looking for a dignified exit strategy whilst doing the best for your customers this might just be for you.\r\n\r\nHere's a couple of reasons why SmallWeb could be the perfect home for your clients.\r\n\r\n- We have servers pretty much globally in UK/US/EU/AU/AS.\r\n- We care about your clients more than their money. I don't claim to be perfect but I always try my best and put as much effort in to help a customer out or to customise to their individual needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe you started recently and your long-term plans have changed. Luckily, mine haven't.\r\nI plan to be active in 5, 10 and 20+ years and hopefully your customers will stick around with me so we can all grow old together while saving money on our hosting.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for:\r\n- Webhosting businesses/clientele. No server hosting.\r\n- DirectAdmin/cPanel based customers only.\r\n- \u00a310,000 or less annual revenue.\r\n\r\nPlease send an email to discuss further at acquisitions @ smallweb.net\r\n\r\nEdit: This was meant to be in offtopic."}
