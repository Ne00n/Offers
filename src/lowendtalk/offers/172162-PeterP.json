You can max out your allocated CPU 24/7, as long as you want. Perfect for anything that needs high performance! VPS operate in a shared environment, and generally only allow you to \"burst\" the CPU for a limited time before throttling you.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Do you have a test IP?\r\nIPv4: 172.99.232.11\r\nIPv6: 2602:fcd3:10:5fa8::1\r\nLooking Glass: [https://lg.yyz.as212934.net/](https://lg.yyz.as212934.net/ \"https://lg.yyz.as212934.net/\")\r\n\r\n* Do you operate your own network?\r\nOur network is entirely our own! We operate our own ASN (AS212934) and provide multi-homed bandwidth, utilizing a mix of Cogent and Hurricane Electric to bring you the best network experience possible.\r\n\r\n* Do you own your equipment?\r\nWe own all our servers and network equipment to ensure the best price-to-performance ratio for our customers.\r\n\r\n* What hardware do you use?\r\nWe use Intel Xeon processors, Redundant Solid State Storage, and certified ECC memory in all our systems to ensure our customers get the best performance and reliability possible.\r\n\r\n* Where are your servers located?\r\nOur servers are located within the Greater Toronto Area (Southern Ontario) in the Great White North.\r\n\r\n* Where can I find your Terms of Service and Acceptable Usage Policy?
