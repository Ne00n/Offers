{"id": 168937, "date": "2020-12-24 00:20:55", "user": "nem", "post": "[ApisCP](https://apiscp.com) turns 18 on [December 26th](https://old.apisnetworks.com/apnscp.php), which is a great milestone as the codebase can now buy fireworks, purchase spray paint, and get tattoos without parental consent.\r\n\r\nTo kick the celebration off and help everyone move past 2020, I'm bringing back the popular 50% off discount (coupon code: **ANNIVERSARY**) valid on all [lifetime licenses](https://my.apiscp.com). This discount is valid until January 1 or reseller support officially launches, whichever happens later.\r\n\r\n**Pro** licenses (no domain limit) are $249, **Startup** (30 domain limit) is $79, and **Mini** (10 domain limit) is $49. These are all one-time costs. Licenses may be revoked and reissued as needed via the licensing portal, [my.apiscp.com](https://my.apiscp.com).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn to interesting developments. As we know by now **CentOS is flipping upstream** to RHEL instead of downstream. I've shared [my thoughts](https://hq.apiscp.com/future-of-centos-in-apiscp/) on this and logged a few days of build hours on [E2E tests](https://api.ara.apiscp.com/?label=c8s). Unless something catastrophic happens by Summer, ApisCP will continue to focus on the Red Hat/CentOS ecosystem to produce the maximum integration afforded by this distro. Having faster release cycles for crucial software like systemd allows me to build more cohesive platforms with less overhead. It's a win.\r\n\r\nTechnology helps accomplish tasks with better precision. **Reseller system**, which is next to launch now that the [panel proxy](https://docs.apiscp.com/admin/Panel%20proxy) is done, uses project quotas and cgroup subtrees to allow overselling with online resource enforcement. Resellers can allocate beyond their package allowances to sites, but the sum of all resources can never exceed the total on the reseller; unlike prevailing reseller systems this is enforced realtime by the OS.\r\n\r\nGiven the ambitious approach to reseller support, ApisCP will only support resellers on **CentOS 8 or Stream with xfs** filesystems. ext4 supports project quotas on 4.x kernels; however, I've not explored it to the same extent as xfs project/group/user quotas. \r\n\r\nLastly, **panel proxy** as touched on earlier allows one to run multiple ApisCP nodes from a single login portal. It's been part of the magic behind Hostineer for the last 5 years and now it's cleaned up for a wider audience. Several great minds in the [ApisCP Discord](https://discord.gg/wDBTz6V) have helped move this along. It's as simple as a couple [configuration settings](https://docs.apiscp.com/admin/Panel%20proxy/#configuration) on each node. Panel proxy is broken down into 3 separate components to enhance security. Each component can be run off a free DNS-only license issued via [my.apiscp.com](https://my.apiscp.com). After reseller is implemented, I'll expand upon this to allow admin to jump locations from a single login.\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.apiscp.com/assets/img/proxy-server-topology-basic.e065c483.svg \"\")\r\n\r\n\r\n@SGraf wait no more. It's here! :D"}
