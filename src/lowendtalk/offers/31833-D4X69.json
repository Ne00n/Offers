For $5.99/mo, you'll get the following specs:\r\n\r\n\r\n+ Quad core @ 3.4GHz\r\n\r\n+ 2GB RAM\r\n\r\n+ 2GB vSwap (This has been lowered due to reasons beyond my control)\r\n\r\n+ 100GB SSD\r\n\r\n+ 4TB monthly Bandwidth @ 100Mbps (Unconfirmed, it's what I assume due to downloads)\r\n\r\n+ 1 IPv4\r\n\r\n+ The secret bonus (which was an additional 3 IPv4) has been removed due to reasons beyond my control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get the server, you simply have to tell me what you would use it for. Winner will be whomever's answer I like the best. The next invoice is due on August 3rd - I will pay this final invoice, and then have the VPS transferred to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome benchmarks:\r\n\r\n+ http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2014/07/27/D6tFaLREwCsIipTn\r\n\r\n+ http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2014/07/27/mNJpUMT9KNV6Tewi\r\n\r\n+ (will add more as they're available)\r\n\r\nTo clarify: I am asking no money for this server. Straight transfer, with you taking over payments on September 3rd. I do have permission from SemoWeb to do this transfer.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: They never mentioned whether it had to be a current client or not, so that is your responsibility to take care of if you win.\r\n\r\nAddition number 1: Sorry, I guess I need to specify. Please comment with your answer."}
