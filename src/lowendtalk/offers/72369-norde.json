At the moment we offer 1Gbit/s unmetered shared connection on all of our services but if you require something more special we can make you a deal on dedicated bandwidth! At the moment we are improving our network to 10 Gigabit/s and this will soon be available.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of our services are semi managed, we are happy to help our customers with whatever issue you may encounter within reason, we may charge a small fee if the task is a little outside of the \"semi-managed\" scope. We also provide specialised media (mostly video) streaming and transcoding services - if you are interested please message us we can sort something out!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[BalkanVPS.com](https://balkanvps.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\nTest IPs:\r\n\r\n185.75.56.65\r\n\r\n84.22.50.247"}
