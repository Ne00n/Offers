So I wanted to just round up this discussion.\r\nPlease suggest the services and service providers that can be regarded as kimsufi alternatives so budget should be anything upto 20 euros or around it. The available uses should be application servers, hosting servers or hypervisors. And please no comments like kimsufi or online.net or someone else is not worth using in production. Please just suggest the providers, their offers with resources and addons. Lets see if we can find some healthy competition to kimsufi."}
