So instead this time it's the whole [V1000 Range](https://pulsedmedia.com/value1000-seedbox.php) + [M10G S](https://pulsedmedia.com/m10g-seedbox.php) and long term discount compoundable special! :)  So there's also an option for RAID5, and lower price point.\r\n\r\nWe really wanted to do another one just like the last ones, but it's taking time to get more servers online.\r\n\r\nThis one is valid for end of the next week, so a bit over a week.\r\nA total of 150 can be purchased on this OR until stock lasts\r\n\r\nSince this is 3rd time in a row of V1000 specials, the discount is 33% ! :) We Wish we could've done the same 50% but just could not get to that -- instead we'll allow this to be combined with long term discounts.\r\n\r\nPrevious threads has plenty of benchmarks and discussion about these. and **_Yes_**, you can use the seedbox for just storage as well. Even Chia plots if that's what you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n**V1000 Series &amp; M10G S: Recurring Discount of 33.01%**\r\n\r\nRecurring, and any payment cycle. No limit on quantity, as long as stock lasts! Can be compounded with long term discounts. Price mentioned is for monthly cycle, annual or longer will be less per month.\r\n\r\n * **V1000 XS**: 1TB Storage, 1GB rTorrent Ram, 1Gbps, 4 000GiB External Traffic, Unlimited Internal Traffic: [~~6.99\u20ac~~ 4.68\u20ac Per Month](https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=228&amp;billingcycle=monthly&amp;promocode=202104let-v10003rdtime)\r\n * **M10G S**: 2TB **RAID5** Storage, 2GB rTorrent Ram, **10Gbps**, 10 000GiB External Traffic, Unlimited Internal Traffic: [~~8.99\u20ac~~ 6.02\u20ac Per Month](https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=215&amp;billingcycle=monthly&amp;promocode=202104let-v10003rdtime)\r\n * **V1000 S**: 4TB Storage, 3GB rTorrent Ram, 1Gbps, 20 000GiB External Traffic, Unlimited Internal Traffic: [~~9.99\u20ac~~ 6.69\u20ac Per Month](https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=229&amp;billingcycle=monthly&amp;promocode=202104let-v10003rdtime)\r\n * **V1000 M**: 6TB Storage, 6GB rTorrent Ram, 1Gbps, Unlimited* External Traffic, Unlimited Internal Traffic: [~~13.99\u20ac~~ 9.37\u20ac Per Month](https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=230&amp;billingcycle=monthly&amp;promocode=202104let-v10003rdtime)\r\n * **V1000 L**: 8TB Storage, 8GB rTorrent Ram, 1Gbps, Unlimited* External Traffic, Unlimited Internal Traffic: [~~16.99\u20ac~~ 11.38\u20ac Per Month](https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=231&amp;billingcycle=monthly&amp;promocode=202104let-v10003rdtime)\r\n\r\nPromocode: 202104let-v10003rdtime\r\nLong term discounts compoundable.\r\n\r\n_Price updates on checkout page._\r\n\r\nCheck them all out at: https://pulsedmedia.com/value1000-seedbox.php  and M10G at https://pulsedmedia.com/m10g-seedbox.php\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluded are:\r\n\r\n * rTorrent / ruTorrent  +  **Deluge**\r\n * Public trackers allowed\r\n * HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, LFTP, SSH access\r\n * sonarr, pyload, flexget, rclone, resilio, syncthing, btsync (1.4 and 2.2), ffmpeg, fuse (unionfs, sshfs, s3fs etc.) etc.\r\n * [Very Strong Privacy Policy](http://wiki.pulsedmedia.com/index.php/Pulsed_Media_Privacy_Policy)\r\n * [14-day full moneyback guarantee](http://wiki.pulsedmedia.com/index.php/Pulsed_Media_Refunds_Policy)\r\n * [Standard seedbox Service Level Agreement(SLA)](http://wiki.pulsedmedia.com/index.php/Pulsed_Media_Seedbox_SLA_Policy)\r\n * [Free Bonus Disk Quota](http://wiki.pulsedmedia.com/index.php/Pulsed_Media_Free_Bonus_Disk_Policy)\r\n * **Setup is INSTANT**\r\n\r\n\r\nExtra info:\r\n\r\n * [Green Datacenter operations](http://blog.pulsedmedia.com/2017/04/steady-progress-green-operations/)\r\n * Datacenter Location: Helsinki, Finland\r\n * Some latency metrics: 20ms DECIX, 36ms OVH, 38ms Online, 0.4-0.6ms Cloudflare, 31ms Leaseweb, 36ms Redstation (UK), 23ms Hetzner (DE), 23ms Serverloft/PlusServer\r\n * [Terms Of Service](http://pulsedmedia.com/terms%20and%20conditions.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n*Payment methods*\r\n\r\n * Paypal\r\n * IBAN/SEPA Wiretransfers\r\n * Crypto (BTC, LTC, XMR, ETH, BTT, **DOGE** and many others.)"}
