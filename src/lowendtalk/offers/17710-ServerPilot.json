Our focus is on a secure, lightweight control panel for developers and VPS owners to manage their own websites on their own servers. If you're a developer with your own servers hosting your websites, you'll love us. If you're selling VPSes, ServerPilot is something many of your clients will love.\r\n\r\nPlease send us questions, feedback, and feature requests.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJustin Samuel  \r\nFounder &amp; CEO, ServerPilot\r\n"}
