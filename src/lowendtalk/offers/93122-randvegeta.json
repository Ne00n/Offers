A few months ago I had some mishap with a shipping company who ended up taking my holding my cargo for ransom and demanding I pay unreasonable 'fees' in order to release it.\r\n\r\nI have some 'revenge' plans but I'd like to see in action but I find myself putting it off to do ACTUAL work instead. So I thought I'd give outsourcing a try.\r\n\r\n1st. I want to assure that my plans are completely legal and amount to little more than posting negative reviews online. So there is nothing particularly nefarious about my plans.\r\n\r\nI don't think the workload would be particularly demanding. It's kind of the opposite of shilling so if you know how much effort goes into shilling then you know what to expect.\r\n\r\nAs for payment, I can provide a VPS or even a dedicated server, depending on which of my plans you are willing to help complete and continue. As for duration, of how long I can provide the VPS.. well this can be anything from a few months to a year. Maybe more but I don't want to make any LONG term promises.\r\n\r\nVPS can be provided in Europe and/or Hong Kong. Anyone interested, PM me!\r\n\r\n@jarland, is this okay or is it against the rules? If against the rules, apologies. I promise nothing illegal will be asked!"}
