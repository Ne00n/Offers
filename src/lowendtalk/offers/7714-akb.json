Seen the birth and gradual makeover (for good or bad ??) of LEB &amp; LET. I have more than dozen OpenVZ LEBs with different providers. But for a small development work of mine I request you guys to point me to the cheapest KVM box out there. Either I am not doing it right or search facility on this forum is quite limited.\r\n\r\nRam: doesn't matter (anything which can run a bare, trimmed down Debian OS is good)\r\nCPU: doesn't matter\r\nDisk: doesn't matter\r\nB/w: doesn't matter\r\nPrice: DOES MATTER. REALLY. Need the absolute cheapest possible thing out there with some sense of reliability also.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your assistance..\r\n\r\n-Regards,\r\nAKB"}
