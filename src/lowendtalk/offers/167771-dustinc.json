We've been growing insanely fast, so it's time for us to give back to the community. We have a limited quantity of these. We're giving away fifteen FREE AMD Ryzen 3900x with Enterprise Intel NVMe in Los Angeles.\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**What specs are the AMD Ryzen VPS?**\r\n\r\n1.5 GB Ryzen VPS\r\n1x AMD Ryzen CPU Core\r\n22 GB NVMe SSD Storage\r\n1.5 GB DDR4 RAM\r\n3000GB Monthly Premium Bandwidth\r\n1Gbps Public Network Port\r\nFull Root Admin Access\r\n1 Dedicated IPv4 Address\r\nKVM / SolusVM Control Panel - Reboot, Reinstall, Manage rDNS, &amp; much more\r\nLOCATION Los Angeles\r\n**Order Link:** https://my.racknerd.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=308 \r\n~~JUST $35.59/Year~~\r\n**$0 for the first year! If you choose to renew after one year, it'll be $35.59/Year.**\r\n\r\n**Want a FREE AMD Ryzen VPS?**\r\n\r\nSimple! Applicable to the first fifteen comments claiming them! One VM allocated per comment/username up to fifteen VPS. You can only win once.\r\n\r\n**What's the catch?**\r\n\r\nYou must be a member of LET for at least a month (no new accounts).\r\nNo surprises, no gimmicks, no obligation to renew. We only ask that if you're claiming one of these FREE AMD Ryzen KVM VPS that you will personally use it - no transfers allowed, do not attempt to sell these. We want those who are claiming a FREE VM (up to the first 15 comments indicating that they'd like one) to actually use the VM themselves.\r\n\r\n**To the winners**\r\nI'll personally be sending you a DM with a registration link, once registered we'll go ahead and provision the VM and release the credentials to you! \r\n\r\n**Didn't win?**\r\nWe'll likely do a few more of these, so no hard feelings :) \r\n"}
