Libreoffice is not an option.\r\n What I'm looking for:\r\n\r\nWindows + Office 2007/2010.\r\nMy last real windows deployment was with win 2000, so I have no idea what kind of specs it needs. It does have to be in the EU, preferably the netherlands. \r\n\r\nWhat can you offer me, and for what price? I have no windows and/or office licenses."}
