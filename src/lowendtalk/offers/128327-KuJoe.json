(_It'll be getting a face lift soon, I promise!_)  \r\n$5.99 Per Month**  \r\n\r\n[You won't find this listed on our site yet so check out the plans here.](https://securedragon.net/clients/cart.php?gid=49)\r\n\r\nOrder any of our plans (even the one that already comes with 12GB of RAM) and include \"**NEED MORE RAM!**\" in the order notes and we'll double your RAM for you.
