The network mix includes PCCW, Telia and TATA with peering at Equinix IX.\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe following plans are available as a launch promotion. They will be available for the next 24 hours only. The order URLs will expire and it won't be possible to order these plans after this.\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 CPU core (12.5% dedicated, burstable up to 100%)\r\n1 GB RAM\r\n10 GB RAID-10 NVMe\r\n500 GB bandwidth\r\n$20 per year\r\nPay for two years - get doubled RAM, storage, and bandwidth\r\nhttps://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/sgp-1g\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n2 CPU cores (50% dedicated, burstable up to 200%)\r\n4 GB RAM\r\n20 GB NVMe SSD\r\n1 TB bandwidth\r\n$35 per year\r\nPay for two years - get doubled RAM, storage, and bandwidth\r\nhttps://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/sgp-4g\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n3 CPU cores (100% dedicated, burstable up to 300%)\r\n8 GB RAM\r\n40 GB NVMe SSD\r\n2 TB bandwidth\r\n$65 per year\r\nPay for two years - get doubled RAM, storage, and bandwidth\r\nhttps://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/sgp-8g\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs this is a new location, some of the things such as IP geolocation might not be fully updated yet and will take the next few days to update.\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd as always - we promise you the best-in-class network performance, and equal or better than any other competitor in the region. We're still making some optimizations to our routes as we go along, but we're always happy to get requests for network optimization in case you see better throughput/latency from other providers in the same area (some common sense exceptions apply) :)\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can ping/trace with lg.sgp.hosthatch.com for now - fully function looking glass will be available in the coming days.\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThank you guys for being with us."}
