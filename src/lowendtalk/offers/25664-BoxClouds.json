Someone else will find better use for it than me. Current location is in Los Angeles but it can be transferred to any of their other 4 locations upon request\r\n\r\n    1GB RAM\r\n    1.2GB vSwap\r\n    4 vCPU Cores\r\n    30GB Disk space\r\n    1TB Bandwidth\r\n    100Mbps uplink (upgraded to 1Gbit uplink)\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    OpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n\r\nPlan expires on **12/10/2014** which is about 6 months from now. Renewable at **$19/yr**.\r\n\r\nLooking to sell at only **$6** via paypal. One thing for sure you get with WLS is great uptime and superb support. If you want something reliable, they are the go to guys. As usual, in order for this transfer you need to create an account with them."}
