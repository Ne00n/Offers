Please try out some of our offers and tell us what you think ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mibbit/gfx/smilies/yel02.png)\r\n\r\nWe also aren't just another Colocrossing provider; we're with Incero.\r\n\r\n**CVZ-128**\r\n\r\n- 1 CPU core\r\n- 128/128MiB RAM/vSwap\r\n- 7GB RAID10 SSD-Cached Space\r\n- 75GiB Data at 1gbps\r\n- 1 IPv4 Address\r\n- Coupon: **X5VD2PRIS0**\r\n- **$3.50** first quarter (**$1.17/mo**), then $5 recurring \r\n- [Order now!](https://azurevps.com/client-area/cart.php?gid=1&amp;pid=1)\r\n\r\n**CVZ-256**\r\n\r\n- 1 CPU core\r\n- 256/256MiB RAM/vSwap\r\n- 15GB RAID10 SSD-Cached Space\r\n- 150GiB Data at 1gbps\r\n- 1 IPv4 Address\r\n- Coupon: **X5VD2PRIS0**\r\n- **$5.60** first quarter (**$1.87/mo**), then $8 recurring\r\n- [Order now!](https://azurevps.com/client-area/cart.php?gid=1&amp;pid=3)\r\n\r\n**CVZ-512**\r\n\r\n- 2 CPU cores\r\n- 512/512MiB RAM/vSwap\r\n- 30GB RAID10 SSD-Cached Space\r\n- 300GiB Data at 1gbps\r\n- 1 IPv4 Address\r\n- Coupon: **IF051VUJ3H**\r\n- **$7.50** first quarter (**$2.50/mo**), then $15 recurring\r\n- [Order now!](https://azurevps.com/client-area/cart.php?gid=1&amp;pid=4)\r\n\r\nCoupon: **IF051VUJ3H** also works for all larger monthly and quarterly plans, and provides a 50% discount off the first invoice.\r\n\r\nA seven day refund is offered for all new customers.\r\n\r\nNone of our RAM nor drive space will be oversold; the plans have been configured such that each's RAM and drive space are exactly double that of the previous one, and along with a proper max resource allocation limit, will prevent the overselling of those resources.\r\n\r\nCurrently the SSD only caches reads, but fortunately the majority of real world IO usage is reads. Write caching will be enabled when we buy our second node. Dirty cache random read IOPs was measured to be [~25K with 4kB blocks, or ~100MB/s](http://pastebin.com/khE3K1qP). CPU and network bandwidth is shared across all VPSs on the node with a fair share policy.\r\n\r\nThe AUP in a nutshell is: Nothing illegal. Nothing constantly resource intensive; Disruptive CPU or network usage will have those resources throttled respectively. IRC, game servers and adult content are allowed.\r\n\r\nAlso, even though we are a new provider, we will reply to all support tickets within 24 hours and strive to provide a pleasant experience as possible.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://azurevps.com/&lt;br /&gt;\r\nNetwork test files: [10MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/10mb.bin) | [100MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/100mb.bin)"}
