Below you will find the two plans that we currently offer that meet LET requirements, we do offer higher tier plans if you need something with more resources.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nHost nodes:&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAll host nodes (inc our OpenVZ product line) are setup with hardware RAID 10 and all utilize dual quad core xeon processors, we do utilize a wide variety of processors so there is no guarantee as to which you will receive. The setup of our XEN product line was done utilizing Intel E5620, however we may use a variety in the future when provisioning servers.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nBoth of the below plans meet LET criteria without the promotional code but we are offering a recurring promotional for the inital release of this product. Please use the coupon code: 25XEN\r\n\r\nThis is a 25% recurring discount on the products listed below, it can also be applied to all other XEN packages which can be viewed on our website. \r\n\r\nLinux-128-XEN (Yearly)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 128MB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSwap Space:128MB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDisk Space: 5GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nBandwidth: 350GB/Month&lt;br&gt;\r\n2 CPU Cores&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IP Address&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nPrice: $26.25/year with 25 discount!&lt;br&gt;\r\nDirect order link: https://123systems.net/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=181&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLinux-256-XEN\r\n\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 256MB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSwap Space: 256MB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDisk Space: 10GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nBandwidth: 500GB/Month&lt;br&gt;\r\n2 CPU Cores&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IP Address&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nPrice: $4.50/month with 25% discount!&lt;br&gt;\r\nDirect order link: https://123systems.net/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=175&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nControl panels:\r\n\r\nWebmin - Free &lt;br&gt;\r\nKloxo/LXA - Free &lt;br&gt;\r\ncPanel/WHM - $12.50/month &lt;br&gt;\r\nDirectAdmin - $6.95/month &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAll XEN templates have PyGrub enabled by default which allows you to run your own kernel inside the DomU rather than being forced to utilize the kernel that resides on the host node.
