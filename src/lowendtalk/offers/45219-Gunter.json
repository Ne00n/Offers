HostUS has since then increased the price of this plan to $15/yr, but this plan is $10/yr to renew. Just wanted to get rid of it, so I'll take any best offer too. Money will be donated to Doctors without Borders/MSF.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I actually don't mind giving this away for free if you have an use for it too."}
