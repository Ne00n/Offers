Our provisioning team has been working on provisioning an additional 90x VPS nodes globally allowing us to replenish stock for both our Intel and Ryzen VPS line up. We have also been working on expanding to more locations for our Ryzen product line (which those locations will be revealed soon!) We've always delivered what we advertised and more, and expand based on the market demand. We have a solid reputation for providing a quality service, we strategically deploy our infrastructure in a manner where our service quality is not compromised, and we're known to provide fast and consistent customer support, after all, you deserve it.\r\n\r\n**OFFICE SPACE EXPANSION:** RackNerd is experiencing rapid growth, so much that we had recently executed an option to exit our term early on our previous office space in Upland, California. We had originally signed for a two-year term at our previous location, and now we\u2019re moving to larger and customized space much sooner than that in order to better position our company to be able to support our continued growth. **We are sharing progress pictures and updates, be sure to follow us at**: [https://twitter.com/racknerd](https://twitter.com/racknerd \"https://twitter.com/racknerd\")\r\n\r\nWe can't thank the community enough for contributing to our growth and for all of the support. We've quickly established ourselves to become renowned as a reliable brand - one that you can count on. This community has been a huge part of our success and we sincerely enjoy contributing to the community. As many of you have noticed we are continuing to contribute guest articles to LowEndBox, and do what we can to give back to this awesome community (we have more giveaways too). Once our new office space is fully ready by August, we'll be doing some more cool stuff too that we'll be able to share shortly :)\r\n\r\nThe past several months have been a battle of selling out quickly and replenishing stock. Despite us not running much promotions here on LET, we've been naturally selling out fast across multiple locations, and today for the first time in a while, we're introducing a new promo based upon our Ryzen &amp; NVMe platform :) **Truly amazing performance at excellent/hot pricing.**\r\n \r\n **We're committed to delivering the hottest/best AMD Ryzen deals on LowEndTalk.
