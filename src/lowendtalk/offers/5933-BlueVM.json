Once you have purchased your VPS it is locked in at that price for life. Individuals are limited to purchasing 5 VPS at the sale price and may transfer the VPS as they see fit after their VPS has been setup. Users may purchase two (or more) VPS and combine them into one larger VPS, however the limit of 5 still applies. As this is a presale you understand that the VPS will not be deployed right away and may take up to 7 business days to be ready. Once we are out of presale stock it is gone. Once the hardware is online the sale will be over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Order Link:** https://www.bluevm.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=107\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDatacenter (not our) test IP/link: http://23.29.117.162/test.tar\r\n\r\nBackup space: All of our VPS come with a free 10 GB backup space (FTP, web based).
