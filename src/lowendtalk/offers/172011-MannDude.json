We're using CloudLinux, DirectAdmin, and Softaculous. Not only is this a rock solid service for general, everyday use type of shared hosting, we let you publish content direct to the 'regular internet' as well as mirror that same content to the Tor and/or the I2P anonymity networks if you wish! Our goal is to push normal, regular, 'every day content' to networks that respect your privacy. This feature is optional and is setup manually, but those who opt in will receive a native .onion address and/or I2P address. (v3 onion, I2P b32 + .i2p upon request). For sites requiring the most privacy, please consider using a VPS and setting up your hidden service or I2P eepsite yourself. We'll have guides posted soon!\r\n\r\n- Ad, tracker, malware, and other \"bullshit\" blocking VPN service! We maintain our own blocklists and DNS cluster to offer an excellent barebones VPN service with an anycast DNS over Tor setup. Locations: Las Vegas, USA - New York, USA - Roost, Luxembourg - Kiev, Ukraine - Helsinki, Finland. We have plans for additional locations but think these five are a good starting point. This is a barebones service. You receive a OpenVPN configuration file (.ovpn) and we encourage you to use OpenVPN's official software/apps to connect. We have no in-house VPN app or software because we can't do it better than the official software from those who manage the protocol. _WireGuard support coming soon, and will be at no extra cost._\r\n\r\n- AMD Ryzen KVM Virtual Servers in Helsinki, Finland! The people want Ryzen, and the people want privacy. We combine both with our Finnish based KVM servers. We currently have very limited VPS capacity due to small initial deployment with Hetzner. New stock will be added as interest is gauged. Additional service locations coming soon, including Moldova (Intel based) and Luxembourg. We are currently renting/leasing hardware due to being a new company and COVID / Crypto negatively impacting the hardware market (IE: It's insanely expensive to build out nodes). We have several location and lease options available to us now, all thanks to relationships formed from a long time in the industry... So keep an eye out!\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe giveaway. \"Okay, cool. I want free stuff!\"\r\n==\r\n\r\nWe our offering the following products for **FREE** as part of a giveaway/contest.
