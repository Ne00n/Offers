You know, that thing with the stuff on this day. This year we made it here on time but we left the flash deals behind and are trying out a more LowEndTalk-friendly style of generating \"activity\" also known as needless bumps by letting everyone spin the whacky VirMach wheel of very wonderful prizes. Also, if you want to potentially waste your time, stick around and hype yourself up, flash deals may make a return soon\u2122 and a little birdie told me something about it being team red.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Post Order # for Bonus Random Prizes&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nReply your 10-digit order number for any of the \"BF 2021 KVM Specials\" and we'll spin the wheel. For now we'll use an online wheel but if Amazon decides to deliver the physical wheel, we'll switch over. Prizes on the wheel may change. Check the updated wheel in comments. \r\n\r\n_These will be done for Black Friday day only, but at our discretion may continue (check comments to verify.)_\r\n\r\n* **Refund to store credit:** We will refund the payment for the qualifying order to your store credit balance. This is a one-time credit.\r\n\r\n* **Ryzen upgrade:** We will upgrade your service to a Ryzen node by the end of the year. \r\n\r\n* **50% off renewal:** When you renew your servicer, it will renew at 50% of the normal renewal rate. This will be recurring.\r\n\r\n* **Spin again:**  Quote and reply to the result within an hour to spin again.\r\n\r\n* **Double bandwidth:** Your service's bandwidth is doubled.\r\n\r\n* **Double RAM:** Your service's memory is doubled.\r\n\r\n* **Double disk:** Your service's disk amount is doubled.\r\n\r\n* **Double service length:** Your service's initial duration is doubled (not recurring.)\r\n\r\n* **Lump of coal:** You don't win anything and can't ever spin the wheel again.\r\n\r\n* **Skip next 3 spins:** The three order numbers posted after yours (by anyone) do not spin.\r\n\r\n* **Next spin halved:** If applicable, the next prize (by anyone) is cut in half. \r\n\r\n* **???:** Wildcard, VirMach will come up with a prize idea unless he's tired, in which case $5 store credit is provided instead.\r\n\r\n* **Price Up:** All advertised services go up $1/YR in price.\r\n\r\n* **Price Down:** All advertised services go down $1/YR in price.\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;BF 2021 KVM Specials&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n_______________________\r\nPublished rates below may change slightly, especially if someone spins the price up or down variable as described above.
