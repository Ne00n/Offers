I'm asking $300 and payments are to be made via PayPal only. I installed it after finding it by accident and free updates and support appear to be included as I was able to install the latest 5.1 version without a problem. This license was originally purchased in 2006. My price is firm. I just finished selling an owned unbranded WHMCS license on WHT and was bombarded with couteroffers even though I also clear that my price was firm on that as well. I can't make another post on WHT for 7 days so I'm going to try and sell the license here on LET. If you're interested let me know."}
