This time around we\u2019ve got up to 78% OFF deals on our [Black Friday MEGA SALE page](https://hello.cloudcone.com/black-friday-yearly-vps-mega-sale/). Below are a few hand-picked plans for you to check out.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve made quite a few improvements to our technology at Cloudcone since the previous Black Friday. For starters we launched our official mobile app which comes with features such as our clients' favorite, to open a support ticket on the move. Mid 2020, we launched one-click applications. This made it possible for our clients to install web applications much faster. And recently we came through with another big, highly anticipated launch, which was our Windows VPS launch. Currently, we\u2019re working on releasing our REST API v2. It\u2019s great knowing that our improvements are able to make life easier for our clients so we hope to continue and do even better next year!\r\n\r\nA small intro about the company, CloudCone, LLC is a Cloud Hosting Services Provider that provides Fully Managed hourly billed cloud virtual private servers, AnyCast DNS, and high-performance bare metal dedicated servers as our primary services.
