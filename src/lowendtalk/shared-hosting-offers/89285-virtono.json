Powered by CloudFlare Railgun**\r\n&lt;br&gt;We're thrilled to announce that we partnered with CloudFlare to bring their Railgun\u2122 technology to you for free. Railgun is a new web optimization technology that increases your site's load time significantly. Websites using Railgun show a 143% improvement in HTML load times and a 90% decrease in time to first byte (TTFB) responses. We invite you to try Railgun for your websites today. CloudFlare's Railgun technology greatly speeds up the delivery of non-cached pages. While CloudFlare automatically caches about 65% of the resources needed to make up a page, 35% can't be cached because the resources are dynamically generated or marked as 'do not cache'. That 35% is often the initial HTML of the page that must be downloaded first. CloudFlare Railgun speeds up this remaining 35%"}
