We had this deal over at [lowendbox](https://lowendbox.com/blog/boomerhost-shared-hosting-for-7-year-in-norway-with-many-extras/ \"lowendbox\"), but I will repost it here because not everyone visits lowendbox. A truly premium shared hosting plan by boomer.host\r\n\r\n**What's unique?**\r\nWe use ApisCP. Below is a preview on how it looks.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mjNhKYB.png \"\")\r\n\r\nIt's a quite nice panel I think. It has some security benefits compared to other alternatives like fortification. But that also makes it more complicated, you have to disable it when you install new plugins and themes only to enable it afterwards. https://apiscp.com/features/fortification. If you don't like it you can just disable it all together, it's up to you.\r\n\r\nWe use Terrahosts Norway server. Here's a test IP: 185.14.97.172\r\n\r\n\r\n**HOST NODE INFO:**\r\n\r\n    AMD Ryzen 5 3600\r\n    64GB RAM\r\n    2x 500GB NVMe SSDs\r\n    10Gbps uplink\r\n\r\nHere's our offer:\r\n\r\nApisCP Hosting\r\n10GB Disk Space\r\nUnlimited Domains\r\n1000GB bandwdith @ 10 Gbps\r\nMailchannels\r\n3GB ram\r\n86 400 CPU seconds (1 second is 1 thread 100% usage for 1 second) Burst away we don't care as long as usage is low overall. Maximal 24-hour CPU usage\r\n100 MB/s IO\r\n5024 IOPS\r\n$7/year\r\n[[ORDER](https://my.boomer.host/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=2&amp;product=4 \"ORDER\")]\r\n\r\nJust to be transparent, I set the CPU seconds high but this might be adjusted in the future should we encounter abusers.\r\n\r\nOne important thing. In ApisCP it automatically creates a mail with your username in it. username@domain.com. So when ordering put a username that you want for your mail. You can also just create another user later\r\n\r\nEnjoy guys and I hope to see you 2022 for our next offerings! Have a nice weekend everyone :)"}
