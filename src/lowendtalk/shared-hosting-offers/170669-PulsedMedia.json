Meaning our DC internal bandwidth will never be limited. External bandwidth has some limits, but the Unlimited* is 60TB and is for fair share purposes, there are other users on the server too.\r\n\r\nAddendum: If we run out this time we might even add a few 4x 12TB or 4x 14TB servers in the mix, and might put a few 24GB ram nodes as well, even tho we've tried to stick with only 48GB for this line up. We'll go and upgrade the ram at later date if that is the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the offer is:\r\n\r\n**V1000 M: Recurring Discount of 50.01%**\r\nThis time a magnificent 80 available at this price point! Recurring, but only maximum 6month payment cycle, so no compounding with annual or longer payment cycle.\r\nThat's quite huge 80*6TB = 480TB or almost half a petabyte :O\r\n\r\n * **V1000 M**: 6TB Storage, 6GB rTorrent Ram, 1Gbps, Unlimited* External Traffic, Unlimited Internal Traffic:  [~~13.99\u20ac~~ 6.99\u20ac Per Month](https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=230&amp;billingcycle=monthly&amp;promocode=202103let-v1000m-50)\r\n * **V1000 S**: 4TB Storage, 3GB rTorrent Ram, 1Gbps, 20 000GiB External Traffic, Unlimited Internal Traffic: [~~9.99\u20ac~~ 4.99\u20ac Per Month](https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=229&amp;billingcycle=monthly&amp;promocode=202103let-v1000m-50)\r\n\r\nPromocode: 202103let-v1000m-50\r\n\r\n**CONSOLIDATION DISCOUNT!
