This of course includes our shared hosting plans.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**What makes our Shared Hosting different than the rest?**\r\n\r\nSure, we're using CloudLinux, DirectAdmin, and Softaculous and offer DDoS protection. Who isn't? While that helps provide a rock solid service for general, everyday use type of shared hosting, we wanted to do something different and stand by our commitment to online privacy by letting you publish content not only direct to the 'regular internet' , but mirror that same content to the Tor and/or the I2P anonymity networks as well if you wish! Our goal is to push _normal, regular, 'every day content'_ to networks that respect your privacy in an effort to encourage normal, regular use of them. This feature is optional and is setup manually, but those who opt-in will receive a random native V3 onion address and/or I2P address. For sites requiring the most privacy, please consider using a VPS and setting up your hidden service or I2P eepsite yourself. We'll have guides posted soon!\r\n\r\nAside from that, we encourage the use of PGP email encryption when sending/receiving mail from your own domain. We have enabled and use the Enigma Encryption plugin for RoundCube which allows you to generate/import your own private key and import public keys from your contacts. (Note: By default the keys are stored securely on the server, which is the only way Enigma can encrypt/decrypt messages. Please consider using a desktop client if you feel more comfortable with that.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Yeah yeah yeah, cool.
