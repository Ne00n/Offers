We have been publicly providing hosting since March 2020 under the AllHost name however have been providing private hosting for over 6 years. We are a registered company in the UK - 13477478 and registered with the ICO.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re from a technical background, not sales, so there\u2019s no pushy marketing with false promises, just simple web-hosting plans on a reliable platform.\r\nWith a combined 14 years in-depth experience of providing technical support and hosting environments to large web-hosting providers, we believe this makes us perfect for ensuring things run fast and remain reliable whilst offering a professional service.\r\n\r\n**What's Standard?**\r\nHosted on enterprise grade hardware in a Midlands (UK) Datacentre served by a multi-homed network with over 1Tbps of outbound capacity.\r\nFull RAID 10 SSDs.\r\ncPanel Control Panel.\r\n\u26a1 JetBackup - Daily Backups with 21 Restore Points.\r\n\u26a1 CloudLinux OS\r\n\u26a1 LiteSpeed Web Server + LSCache\r\n\u26a1 MailChannels\r\nImunify360\r\nFree SSL Provided by AutoSSL + Sectigo\r\nFree Migrations\r\nPHP Versions 5.4 to 8.0\r\nEnterprise DDoS Protection\r\n\r\n**What's the deal?**\r\nDue to the resources of a server being disproportionately used (i.e. very low CPU/RAM but high usage of storage space), AllHost are able to offer up the following package offer for a very low cost.\r\n\r\n**CP Mini (Shared Hosting)**\r\nUp to 1 Domain\r\n5GB SSD Storage\r\n1 vCPU + 1GB RAM + 25 EP\r\n\u00a33.60 PER YEAR (approx $5.00)\r\nPlan will renew at \u00a37.20 PER YEAR / $10 after the first year.\r\n\r\nOrder link [here](https://portal.allhost.co.uk/order/main/packages/hostingspecial/?group_id=8 \"here\")\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n-If an upgrade to your plan or storage quota would be required in future this would result in your account being migrated to a different cPanel server rather than a simple quota increase. Whilst disruption for migrations can be kept incredibly low, it would not be a simple case of just increasing quota.\r\n\r\n-Due to the low retail price and to prevent abuse; the maximum hourly outbound emails is restricted to 20 on the CP Mini plan.\r\nIf you require higher email volume then you can opt out of MailChannels if desired.\r\n\r\n-Limited availability.\r\n\r\nYou can find our normal plans listed [here](https://allhost.co.uk/cpanel-web-hosting/ \"here\")\r\nEmail: sales@allhost.co.uk\r\n\r\nWe also offer Reseller Hosting and Managed cPanel VPS.\r\n\r\n[https://allhost.co.uk/](https://allhost.co.uk/ \"https://allhost.co.uk/\")\r\n"}
