We have spent many years buying hosting ourselves and know what kind of a host a customer wants. We sell unmanaged VPS's, but we provide as much support as we can. We will even help customers set up game servers on their VPS's as well. Our VPS's can have Windows (Bring Your Own License). Our goal is to provide fast support, high quality VPS's at an affordable rate. We utilize SpartanHost through Psychz Datacenter to host our nodes in Dallas, Texas. We have been in the business for over 6 months now and have grown to now provide dedicated servers and shared web hosting. We are your affordable and sustainable hosting solution.\r\n\r\nOur company has recently expanded into webhosting to provide an affordable easy solution for those who don't necessarily need a large robust VPS, but want a solution that will easily get their website done. All of our plans include CPanel and Softaculous app installer, so you can install your apps easier than ever! You can install apps right from the control in 1 click such as Opencart, Wordpress, etc.\r\n\r\n**Website: https://micronodes.net**\r\n\r\n100 MB Test File: https://micronodes.net/testfile/100MB.zip\r\n\r\nTest IP: 104.194.219.194\r\n\r\n\r\nNode Specs:\r\n- Intel Xeon E3 1270v1 @ 3.4GHz+ (4 cores/8 threads)\r\n- 32 gb DDR3 ECC RAM\r\n- 5TB HDD (4 HDDs) (Raid Protected)\r\n- 1Gbps uplink (Backed by 10gbps fiber port)\r\n\r\n\r\nEach Shared Hosting Plan is backed by a 1gbps uplink hosted on a 10gbps network port.
