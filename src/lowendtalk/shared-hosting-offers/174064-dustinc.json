Miami was one of our strong candidates on our recent poll, and we\u2019re proud to be expanding here, as the community has expressed interest in this location. We are located within the Digital Realty Miami facility \u2013 structurally designed to withstand Category 5 Hurricanes!  \r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://my.racknerd.com/index.php?rp=/store/shared-hosting-promotions-multiple-locations\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://blog.racknerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shared-reseller-hosting-miami.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nWe understand the demand within the shared and reseller hosting landscape, by end-users and reseller's choice, is still today leaning towards cPanel &amp; WHM. It is a control panel that end-users (both tech savvy and non tech savvy) are most familiar with, enabling our resellers to be successful in conversions, and allowing them to scale their business as a result.\r\n\r\n**FREE CLIENTEXEC LICENSE:** We are now offering FREE Clientexec licenses to our customers! The only requirement is that there is a limit of one per active client account, so if you are not yet a customer of ours, ordering any of the below packages would qualify you for a FREE Clientexec license for use within our network ($143.40/Year value for FREE). See our [LowEndTalk thread](https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/173759/whmcs-alternative-free-clientexec-license-exciting-news-giveaway/p1 \"LowEndTalk thread\") for more information on how to claim your FREE Clientexec license.\r\n\r\nDuring the order checkout process on any of the below promo\u2019s, you will see the ability to choose the location you wish for your account to be deployed in, including our newest location Miami.
