Got anything for me?**\r\n\r\n*Yes of course. I love tending to you cheapos &lt;3 PM me for a custom deal!*\r\n\r\n**Do you offer Support?**\r\n\r\n_Our Service is \"unmanaged\". Support is limited to answering inquiries that are related to billing and/or uptime issues. We do provide a Knowledge Base that has yet to grow to a decent size however if there are any issues at hand do not hesitate to contact us as we will always strive to point you into the right direction_ :-)  \r\n\r\n**What about Backups?**\r\n\r\n*We do not take other backups than those necessary for an event of system failure. You are allowed to take backups via cPanel Wizard however DO NOT STORE THEM on your disk space as it is only allocated for direct Website usage. You are free to take FTP/Offsite backups or download them without any problems! \r\nPlease remember to continously backup your account as we will not be held responsible for any data that is lost during any event of service outage. In case you are in desperate need of a backup please contact us as we still will try to help you out (for a processing fee that is). Restoration of backups is entirely of your concern. If in any case we provide backup data it is your task to restore it accordingly.*\r\n\r\n**Can I order a dedicated IP Adress?**\r\n\r\n*Yes. Please open a Ticket.*\r\n\r\n**Do you offer...?**\r\n\r\n*Contact me via PM or via Support Ticket*\r\n\r\n**Is XYZ allowed?**\r\n\r\n_We do not allow file hosting/sharing platforms, adult content/porn, free hosting services and any other resource hungry projects on our plans. For 99% of website users 1 GB Memory usage and 1 vCPU should be more than enough though. If you are still unsure about this open a ticket for a bespoke solution._ \r\n\r\n**Are orders processed automatically?**\r\n\r\n_Some are and some are not. If you are a new client we might manually process your order which can take up to 24 hours. Normally though orders regarding Web Hosting are provisioned automatically within ~5-10 minutes. Orders for the Reseller Plans are being reviewed manually.\r\n_\r\n\r\n"}
