{"id": 173871, "date": "2021-09-13 22:04:13", "user": "dustinc", "post": "![](https://my.racknerd.com/assets/img/logo.png  \"\")\r\n\r\nWe recently posted a survey here on LET to seek feedback as to what locations the community has interest in, for competitively priced shared &amp; reseller hosting deals. We decided to fulfill what the community expressed interest in, and have expanded this product line to numerous locations since then, including Germany and France. And today, we have one more location expansion to announce :)\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://blog.racknerd.com/racknerd-llc-iaas-provider-announces-launch-of-its-asia-pacific-datacenter-in-singapore/\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://blog.racknerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shared-reseller-hosting-singapore.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nToday, we are pleased to announce that we have expanded our shared and reseller hosting product line to Singapore! In Singapore, we are located within the Equinix SG2 datacenter and leverage a network blend consisting of GCX, NTT, TATA, Equinix Peering :)\r\n\r\nWhile Singapore has a reputation for being a very expensive/premium region for hosting due to increased real estate and bandwidth costs, we are able to deliver at pricing/value that is very hard to find elsewhere. We're able to deliver a solid service that our customers can count on (great reliability), at cost-effective rates.\r\n\r\nWe want to enable our customers &amp; resellers, to have a feature packed offering. Our offerings include LiteSpeed Web Server w/ LSCache, free daily offsite backups with JetBackup V5 integrated with Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage, MailChannels Hybrid, Softaculous, CloudLinux, KernelCare, and a [FREE Clientexec license](https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/173759/whmcs-alternative-free-clientexec-license-exciting-news-giveaway#latest \"FREE Clientexec license\") - we strongly believe that features like this are important, especially for conversions. This is also one of the main reasons why we utilize the cPanel/WHM control panel for our shared/reseller hosting product line. Despite cPanel licensing pricing being more costly than its alternatives, we're still able to deliver shared and reseller hosting deals at cost-effective rates, and because the market/end-users are most familiar with this control panel, this, in addition to all of our features, ultimately enables our resellers/customers to be successful.\r\n\r\n**NEW FEATURES:**\r\n\r\n- Now running on [JetBackup V5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCxY630qsqM \"JetBackup V5\") -- clients can now individually restore files, databases, ability to manage your customer's backups as a reseller, AND MORE!  We don't just claim to have backups, customers actually have full access, visibility, and control over their backups via the JetBackup V5 interface! We care about our customer's continued success, which is why we invest resources in business continuity features such as this one.\r\n\r\n- Our FREE daily offsite backups powered by JetBackup V5 are now integrated with **Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage** at no additional charge -- this means faster downloads, faster restores, and additional redundancy!\r\n\r\n- We now have a **30-day retention period** at no additional charge for all backups, compared to our previous 5 day retention period!\r\n\r\n**FREE CLIENTEXEC LICENSE:** We are now offering FREE Clientexec licenses to our customers! The only requirement is that there is a limit of one per active client account, so if you are not yet a customer of ours, ordering any of the below packages would qualify you for a FREE Clientexec license for use within our network ($143.40/Year value for FREE).
