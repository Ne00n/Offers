First and most importantly, the promotional code \"HALF\" for 50% off applicable plans has been increased to a maximum number of 99 uses, instead of being time based. That means at the time of this thread, there are 55 uses left. Take this as subtle symbolism that massive promotions are being wound down and will become rarer in the future. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we're trialing the DirectAdmin Pro Back beta release in our secondary Amsterdam server. We are planning to convert our infrastructure from CloudLinux to the Pro Pack in the future. You can find more about that on our blog. Current features include user resource throttling, automatic SSL certificates and application management through Nginx Unit. We've set resource limits similar to those used with CloudLinux: 20MB/s I/O and 50 \"tasks\" for our shared hosting plans. We're looking to find the sweet spot.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we're now offering more billing periods for our plans including 1GB at only \u00a30.50p per month.\r\n\r\nSee our plans below!\r\n\r\n1GB - \u00a30.50/month or \u00a30.25 with code HALF.\r\n\u2705 Host 10 Websites\r\n\u2705 Unlimited SQL Databases\r\n\u2705 1GB NVMe Storage\r\n\u2705 250GB Monthly Transfer\r\n\u2705 Unlimited Email Accounts\r\n\u2705 Softaculous Apps Installer\r\n\u2705 Free Let's Encrypt SSL\r\n\u2705 DirectAdmin Control Panel\r\n\u2705 OpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\n\u274c Isolated SSH Access \r\n\r\n2GB - \u00a31.00/month or \u00a30.50 with code HALF.\r\n\u2705 Host 20 Websites\r\n\u2705 Unlimited SQL Databases\r\n\u2705 2GB NVMe Storage\r\n\u2705 Unmetered Monthly Transfer\r\n\u2705 Unlimited Email Accounts\r\n\u2705 Softaculous Apps Installer\r\n\u2705 Free Let's Encrypt SSL\r\n\u2705 DirectAdmin Control Panel\r\n\u2705 OpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\n\u2705 Isolated SSH Access \r\n\r\n5GB - \u00a32.00/month or \u00a31.00 with code HALF.\r\n\u2705 Unlimited Websites\r\n\u2705 Unlimited SQL Databases\r\n\u2705 5GB NVMe Storage\r\n\u2705 Unmetered Monthly Transfer\r\n\u2705 Unlimited Email Accounts\r\n\u2705 Softaculous Apps Installer\r\n\u2705 Free Let's Encrypt SSL\r\n\u2705 DirectAdmin Control Panel\r\n\u2705 OpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\n\u2705 Isolated SSH Access \r\n\r\n10GB - \u00a33.00/month or \u00a31.50 with code HALF.\r\n\u2705 Unlimited Websites\r\n\u2705 Unlimited SQL Databases\r\n\u2705 10GB NVMe Storage\r\n\u2705 Unmetered Monthly Transfer\r\n\u2705 Unlimited Email Accounts\r\n\u2705 Softaculous Apps Installer\r\n\u2705 Free Let's Encrypt SSL\r\n\u2705 DirectAdmin Control Panel\r\n\u2705 OpenLiteSpeed Web Server\r\n\u2705 Isolated SSH Access \r\n\r\nOrder form: https://portal.smallweb.net/order/main/index/shared\r\n\r\nQuestions?
