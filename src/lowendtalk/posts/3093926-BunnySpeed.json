Of course, we're joining in, this year with a proper Easter Egg hunt. I've heard that sometimes Easter Eggs are appearing on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bunnycdn.com/\">BunnyCDN </a> landing pages.

I guess that they can be used only once and sometimes two people find a code at the same time? Maybe they'll work again later on... only <a href=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/profile/BunnySpeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">@BunnySpeed</a> knows!</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>That's strange, from what I can see I think it's due to account limits. Actually, everyone can find multiple codes, but to prevent abuse they're limited to 4 per account. If I'm wrong, please, by all means, open a ticket with the full code and we'll have a look.</p>\n</div>\n"}
