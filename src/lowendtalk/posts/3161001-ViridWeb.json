I wonder if it's because viridweb loses some kind of reputation score when they do too many refunds</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>We have to send refund manually as per Indian law we can't hold money on our paypal account.</p>\n<p>Most of time we are sending payment of $7 to $8 when user paid $6</p>\n<p>We have failed to provide services to user so it's pur duty to refund them in full amount no matter how much money we lost</p>\n</div>\n"}
