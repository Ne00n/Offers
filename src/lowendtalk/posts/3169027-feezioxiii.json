We actually don't have any profit on those sales (if not losses) which is why the quantity is extremely limited, our regular sales revenue can cover the cost and make things sustainable in the long run <img class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/lol.png\" title=\":D\" alt=\":D\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The offer is out of stock at the moment, thank you for all the support guys!</p>\n<p>If you guys have any questions, please open up a ticket and we will get it sorted <img class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/wink.png\" title=\";)\" alt=\";)\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</div>\n "}
