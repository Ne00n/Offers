What network bandwidth do they have?</p>\n<p>Can these only be used with \"www.domain\" or also \"randomstring.domain\"? Your signup form seems to imply the former.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Hah, I updated my post exactly as you posted, with server location <img class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://www.lowendtalk.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":smile:\" alt=\":smile:\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>No, location is at Hetzners in Germany, running on the 32core EPYC server. That means unlimited traffic and a 1GBit/s port speed.</p>\n<p>You can create all the subdomains you want. We use DirectAdmin and have set every feature to \"Unlimited\", so you can have all the domains, subdomains etc. you want. You can either buy a domain from us or move it from whichever registrar you have, or simply change DNS to us - so you can create whatever.domain.com if that is what you mean?</p>\n</div>\n"}
