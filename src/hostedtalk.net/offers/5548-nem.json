Lifetime licenses have been added for <strong>Startup</strong> ($159, 30 domains) and <strong>Mini</strong> ($99, 10 domains) classes which are perfect complements for smaller cloud servers. <strong>Pro</strong> ($499) has no domain restrictions. A special promotion is available until October 1:</p>\n<p>Use coupon code <strong>JOY32</strong> at <a href=\"https://my.apiscp.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">checkout</a> for 50% off any lifetime license.</p>\n<p>Lifetime licenses work with all future versions of ApisCP.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Since the initial release announcement, 3.2 has continued to evolve, separating Web Apps into their <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Awebapp+org%3Aapisnetworks&amp;type=Repositories\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">own modules</a> and adding <a href=\"https://docs.apiscp.com/admin/Docker/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Docker</a> support.</p>\n<p>Multi-server support is getting a makeover next. Keep your eyes peeled on <a href=\"https://github.com/apisnetworks/cp-proxy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">apisnetworks/cp-proxy</a>. As requested, MSS will allow jumping between servers as admin and transparent SSO into domains on other servers.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned! <img src=\"https://hostedtalk.net/images/emoji/google/heart.png?v=9\" title=\":heart:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":heart:\"></p>"}
