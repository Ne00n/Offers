It is currently ranked the second most important financial center, right after New York City (which we are also in!), and home to the world\u2019s third largest internet exchange. There is no reason not to Brenter!<br>\nOur London datacenter is located in the historic London Docklands business district overlooking the Canary Wharf. DDCL is also home to one of Europe\u2019s largest peering exchanges, LINX.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Looking for a test IP and test download file?

To our future family members, there is never a wrong time to join the family.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us! If you have any good suggestions on how we can improve, we are all ears!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>P.S : Once London is live, we are going to put all our future expansion on hold for the next 18 months. This is extremely crucial for us to focus on stabilizing our business While time to time, we may run smaller limited promos here and there, but we are definitely moving away from going crazy with promos every other week. (Roy yells at me too much for those :/) . We are moving a decent portion of our monthly marketing budget to improve our current infrastructures and services.</p>\n<p>We will continue to research the market to improve our current offerings and your honest, constructive feedback is crucial to us.</p>"}
