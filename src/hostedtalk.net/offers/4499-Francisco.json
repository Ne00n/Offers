Ain\u2019t that sweet?</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re buying multiple nodes we can do any customizing you want (specific SSD\u2019s you want installed, etc) saving you on future remote hands. You\u2019d just have to mail the drives to us in Vegas. We can also pre-badge &amp; pre-configure all IPMI\u2019s to your specifications.</p>\n<p>Francisco</p>"}
