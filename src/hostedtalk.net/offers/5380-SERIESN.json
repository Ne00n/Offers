Once a British colonial trading post, today Singapore is a thriving global financial hub and described as one of Asia\u2019s economic \u201ctigers\u201d. What do you know, Singapore is quite the \u201cbeast\u201d!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Singapore is a particularly well connected region, allowing local users to significantly reduce their latency time. If majority of user users are connecting from the asian region, spare them the stress and the anger, that is caused by slow loading websites. You can deploy your service in our Singapore Location today! <em>Don\u2019t keep the Merlion waiting</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://hostedtalk.net/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1208acf8bd8398c81e0fadee4e7bd4775df5819a.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"2zxbhDd0OHY5PaVbveS6G6tZY4a\" width=\"503\" height=\"500\"></p>\n<h3>Special Offer: Bob\u2019s Pizza Party</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many of you may be familiar with Bob.
