We have decided to expand into virtual servers and shared hosting to the public. We are offering brand new and exclusive offers to all new and recurring clients. This offers will be recurring and only available within 1-3 months of this post.</p>\n<p>Now, let me tell you about us. <a href=\"http://Hosterlabs.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Hosterlabs.net</a> is a company dedicated to it\u2019s customer support service and quality while offering extremely cheap virtual servers. We mainly focus on windows and linux KVM virtual servers.</p>\n<p>We love performance and reliability. This is why we offer soft RAID 0 NVMe Storage in all our servers. This might seem rather limited, as we offer around 20-40 GB of storage. But we are not offering storage servers, rather performance focused ones. Read and writes speeds theoretically can reach 3.1Gb/s in our servers. So if you are looking for storage intensive solutions we might not be the answer. Nevertheless, if you look to maximize performance and speed, we are definitely the solution.</p>\n<p>We have 3.8 Ghz CPU\u2019s, NVMe Storage in RAID 0 and DDR 4 ECC ram at 2133 Mhz. This shows that our main focus and market is with performance users and applications.</p>\n<p>You can check our offerings here for linux : <a href=\"https://hosterlabs.net/vps-kvm-linux/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Virtual Private Servers | Hosterlabs</a></p>\n<p>We currently offer Linux servers :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unmetered Bandwidth @ 100Mbps [ you can increase up to 400 Mbps ]</li>\n<li>4 GB of RAM</li>\n<li>1 vCPU</li>\n<li>1 IPv4</li>\n<li>20 GB NVMe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Price: 2,99$ + Payment gateway fees.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unmetered Bandwidth @ 100Mbps [ you can increase up to 400 Mbps ]</li>\n<li>8 GB of RAM</li>\n<li>2 vCPU</li>\n<li>1 IPv4</li>\n<li>30 GB NVMe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Price: 9.99 + Payment gateway fees.</p>\n<p>And our offerings for windows:  <a href=\"https://hosterlabs.net/vps-kvm-windows/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Virtual Private Servers Windows | Hosterlabs</a></p>\n<p>Starting at 4,99$/mo + payment gateway fees.</p>\n<p>We are a bit limited on stock for now, so we are looking if there is interest from the community to expand our services and provision extra nodes. We might provision OpenVZ instead of KVM servers with more resources if we run out of space in our nodes.</p>\n<p>We are committed into customer satisfaction, transparency and quality between our clients and us.</p>"}
