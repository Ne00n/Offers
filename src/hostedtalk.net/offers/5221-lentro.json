Thought I might give a shameless promo for you all to become FluidStack providers too.</p>\n<p><strong>What is FluidStack?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are like an Airbnb but for GPU servers. <strong>You host your machine(s), we rent them, and our customers use them for machine learning, CAD rendering, etc.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>We are backed by some original investors of SpaceX, Revolut, and Transferwise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our virtual desktop platform is growing fast, and we need more providers!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fill out a quick application form <strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZO04k2H8NvbaZu43OWq8bekkvbrHvELh2ZOwZfATt4wnZWA/viewform\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here to become a supplier</a></strong>\n</li>\n<li>Once approved, follow 5 minute setup instructions to give us access to your fully dedicated machine</li>\n<li>Sit back and relax. We rent the machine, and you get <strong>guaranteed monthly payouts</strong> even if it\u2019s not always used!</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Payouts</strong><br>\nPayouts made at start of each month via PayPal. We solely pay for the GPU; we do not compensate for CPU/RAM/bandwidth. If I included rates for all supported GPUs, it would go on forever, so I\u2019m just including two examples. Payout rates for <em>your</em> GPU can be seen after <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZO04k2H8NvbaZu43OWq8bekkvbrHvELh2ZOwZfATt4wnZWA/viewform\" title=\"approved\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">approved</a>.</p>\n<p>Current Per-GPU payout:<br>\nNIVIDA Tesla V100: $310/month<br>\nNVIDIA GeForce 2080 Ti: $90/month</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>\n<p>System Requirements?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Fully dedicated machine</strong> with 8+ GB of RAM, 200 GB of disk space, 5+ Mbps guaranteed bandwidth</li>\n<li>NVIDIA GPU including: a100, v100, 2080ti, 2080 Super, 2080, 2070 Super, 2070, 2060 Super, 2060, 1080 Ti, 1080, 1070, 1070 Ti, 1060 6GB, 1060 3GB, 1050 Ti, or 1050</li>\n<li>Windows or Linux</li>\n<li>Virtualization and IOMMU support</li>\n<li>SSH access</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Security?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do our best to keep providers secure: happy providers = more GPUs = larger business. If you are hosting a machine from your home, understand that someone else will have access. Personally, I would suggest firewalling LAN addresses and patching CPU vulnerabilities just in case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>V100 and 2080/Ti/Supers have the fastest waiting lists (few days) - others might take a bit longer</li>\n<li>Tampering or excessive downtime will result in no payouts</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Need Affordable GPU Servers?</strong></p>\n<p>Rent machines with GPUs from virtually anywhere in the world <a href=\"https://www.fluidstack.io/virtual_desktop/\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Closing Notes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Whether you want to become a provider or a customer, there has never been a better time to join!</strong></p>\n<p>Post questions that benefit everyone down below, and contact us at <a href=\"mailto:sales@fluidstack.io\" title=\"sales@fluidstack.io\">sales@fluidstack.io</a> for individual/private inquiries.</p>"}
