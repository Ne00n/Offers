I know not everyone wants managed/semi-managed services, so by early June our unmanaged VPS range should be live when they\u2019ll be some launch offers for the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Semi-managed dual storage VPS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>KVM virtualisation, Germany location</li>\n<li>2 core (Ryzen)</li>\n<li>4GiB ECC ram</li>\n<li>25GiB NVMe OS drive</li>\n<li>\n<s>250</s> 500GiB HDD storage</li>\n<li>2 x IPv4, 2 x /64 IPv6</li>\n<li>\u00a320/month</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://console.vmspecialist.com/order/config/index/order/?group_id=2&amp;pricing_id=43\">Order</a> - Use coupon BALLS10</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perfect for when you need reasonable resources and NVMe speeds, but also need some HDD space too. Specs can be customised if required.</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s covered by \u201csemi-managed\u201d?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of our line up is fully managed which means there\u2019s no virtualisor panel, etc, and orders are manually provisioned to suit client requirements.<br>\nSemi-managed means your VPS will be provisioned setup as requested, including any custom partitioning, but you\u2019re then you\u2019ll get full root access and be free to setup your own software as required going forward. Full support is then available to help keep your needs met, but you\u2019re still in control of the day to day running of the server. Semi-managed services also don\u2019t benefit from managed offsite backups.</p>\n<p><strong>Fully managed dedicated servers</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019ve also got some dedicated servers in stock and available, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intel E-2276G (6 x 3.8Ghz - 4.9Ghz turbo + hyperthreading)</li>\n<li>16 GB ECC ram</li>\n<li>2 x 512GB NVMe drives</li>\n<li>1 x IPv4, /64 IPv6</li>\n<li>Full management - you tell us your setup and we\u2019ll make it happen including migrations, backups, etc. This includes full phone support as required.</li>\n<li>Amsterdam, NL</li>\n<li>\u00a3145/month with discount</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full range available <a href=\"https://console.vmspecialist.com/order/main/packages/order/?group_id=4\">here</a>, including Frankfurt and London ranges.
