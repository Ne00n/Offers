All equipment is fully owned, equity financed and runs on our own network in the InterXion VIE1, one of the largest datacenters in Austria. As a RIPE NCC member, we also own all IPs assigned to any client and currently operate the equivalent of a /21 IPv4 subnet to offer our services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Network</h2>\n<p>\u2022 Looking Glass: <a href=\"https://www.alwyzon.com/lg/vie\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">alwyzon.com/lg/vie</a><br>\n\u2022 Test IPv4: 46.102.157.45<br>\n\u2022 Test IPv6: 2a0d:f302:100::2<br>\n\u2022 Test Download File: <a href=\"https://lg.vie.alwyzon.net/25MB.test\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">25 MB</a> <a href=\"https://lg.vie.alwyzon.net/50MB.test\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">50 MB</a> <a href=\"https://lg.vie.alwyzon.net/100MB.test\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">100 MB</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<p><strong>Will we see more locations anytime soon?</strong><br>\nNo, definitely not. Think of Alwyzon more like a small boutique; there aren\u2018t any intentions to build up a global spanning reach. On the contrary, lots of thought have been put into whether it\u2018s even worth to have two locations to maintain. But, as an Austrian company and since Austria is a much more underserved market than the Netherlands anyhow, that opportunity could not be passed up when a suitable deal arose.</p>\n<p><strong>Why isn\u2019t there any Virtual Server S plan in Austria?</strong><br>\nThe Virtual Server S is the by far most sold plan in the Dutch location, but it is also the plan with the lowest profit margin and those prices simply are not economical at the operating costs that we have to face in Vienna. So for now, these plans are not yet available in Austria.</p>\n<p><strong>What payment methods do you support?</strong><br>\nYou can pay via Credit Cards (processed by Stripe*), BanContact, EPS, giropay, iDeal and Paypal. If none of these payment methods is applicable to you, open a support ticket to pay via SEPA wire transfer.</p>\n<p>*We know your credit card information is very sensitive and thus we will never store your credit card details on our servers. Instead, those are handled by the payment processor Stripe and we only store a token and the last four digits for later reference.</p>\n<p><strong>How long until my virtual server is ready to use?</strong><br>\nProvisioning of new virtual servers is fully automated and takes about 5 minutes. As soon as your payment is received, the setup process is automatically launched for the operating system you selected in the checkout form. (Provided that our system didn\u2019t flag you for manual review.)</p>\n<p><strong>What kinds of usages are accepted?</strong><br>\nIn short: keep it legit and don\u2019t abuse the provided resources. No email spam, no file sharing, no Tor nodes, no Torrent and nothing that will hammer the shared CPU cores to 100% 24/7 (= no crypto currency miners, please). For a more detailed list, see the \u201cAccepted Usage Policy\u201d section of our <a href=\"https://www.alwyzon.com/terms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What operating systems are supported?</strong><br>\nYou can either pick from the latest CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSuse or Ubuntu releases pre-installed on your virtual server; or you can upload any ISO and install whatever operating system you would like to use instead.</p>\n<p><strong>What level of support is provided?</strong><br>\nThese are unmanaged virtual server offers, so you are expected to install and configure the server yourself. You get root access to the virtual server and a Linux distribution pre-installed, but you will have to setup any software according to your requirements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Alwyzon is a trading name of Hohl IT e.U, a company registered at the court of Graz (Austria), company number 538746z.
