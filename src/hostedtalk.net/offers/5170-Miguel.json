We\u2019re happy the way it is - small, profitable, easy to manage.</p>\n<p>Some members here know that I and my girlfriend are expecting our first baby (21 weeks today!), so I\u2019ve not only launched this promotion to celebrate our anniversary, as to fund a few acquisitions we need for our house to accommodate him - new couch, fridge, and other stuff that parents need. All the funds on this sale will be solely to improve our house. If you\u2019d like to help, get one of these specials, which are all recurring.<br>\nNote: This thread was posted on LET, LES and HB.<br>\n(The DE server will be migrated to a Ryzen next Sunday!)</p>\n<p>Coupons, first come first served:</p>\n<p><strong>HIBOY</strong> - 5 Coupons, Reseller Entry, paid annually for 40\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)<br>\n<strong>HAPPYDAY</strong> - 5 Coupons, Reseller Advanced, paid annually for 80\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)<br>\n<strong>LILMIKE</strong> - 10 Coupons, Shared Basic, paid annually for 20\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)<br>\n<strong>PRESIDENT</strong> - 10 Coupons, Shared Pro, paid annually for 40\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)<br>\n<strong>CRAZYBASTARD</strong> - 2 Coupons, Reseller Entry, paid annually for 30\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)<br>\n<strong>CRAZYMIKE</strong> - 2 Coupons, Reseller Advanced, paid annually for 60\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)<br>\n<strong>COUCH</strong> - 30 Coupons, Shared Basic, paid annually for 25\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)<br>\n<strong>FRIDGE</strong> - 20 Coupons, Shared Basic, paid annually for 45\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can\u2019t be used to replace existing services)</p>\n<p>Plans we have available:</p>\n<p><strong>Shared Hosting plans:</strong></p>\n<p>Basic<br>\n25GB SSD<br>\nUnmetered Bandwidth<br>\nUnlimited Domains<br>\n<a href=\"https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=8\" title=\"ORDER NOW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a><br>\nLocations: DE &amp; LA</p>\n<p>Basic<br>\n50GB SSD<br>\nUnmetered Bandwidth<br>\nUnlimited Domains<br>\n<a href=\"https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=9\" title=\"ORDER NOW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a><br>\nLocations: DE &amp; LA</p>\n<p><strong>Reseller Hosting plans:</strong></p>\n<p>Entry<br>\n50GB SSD<br>\nUnmetered Bandwidth<br>\nUnlimited Accounts<br>\n<a href=\"https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=6\" title=\"ORDER NOW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a><br>\nLocations: DE &amp; LA</p>\n<p>Advanced<br>\n100GB SSD<br>\nUnmetered Bandwidth<br>\nUnlimited Accounts<br>\n<a href=\"https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=7\" title=\"ORDER NOW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORDER NOW</a><br>\nLocations: DE &amp; LA</p>\n<p>CloudLinux limits:</p>\n<p>200% CPU<br>\n2GB RAM<br>\n4096 IOPs<br>\n10MB/s Disk<br>\n50 Entry Processes<br>\n200 Processes</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>"}
