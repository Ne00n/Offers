Our goal is to propose the best user experience with friendly support.</p>\n<p>We propose different solutions, such as web hosting, game hosting, and virtual machines.</p>\n<p>But recently we launched our brand new S3 service.<br>\nOur S3 service is used by our self for our backups and other critical services, such as video deliveries for some customers.</p>\n<p>We founded out the lack of S3 services, that are not pricy (AWS looking at you here), or that have some weirdo TOS about download/upload ratio (Wasabi looking at you here).<br>\nWe were pretty unhappy with every S3 service we were using, but we founded an alternative.</p>\n<p>The S3 service of Poli Systems is highly reliable, here are some features :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Triple replication across 3 different physical machines</li>\n<li>Live replication in two different data centers located in Switzerland</li>\n<li>Swiss data privacy</li>\n<li>No API requests fees</li>\n<li>Unlimited bandwidth usage, for free, yes free.</li>\n<li>Highly reliable data replication.</li>\n<li>Fast retrieval speeds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of this service is to provide a cheap and good alternative to big companies like AWS. We think that the main usage of this service can be interesting for backups. After a lot of testing it\u2019s faster to recover data (1\u2019000-8\u2019000 mbits) than uploading as it needs to replicate 3 times (don\u2019t worry uploads are fast too <img src=\"https://hostedtalk.net/images/emoji/google/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=10\" title=\":stuck_out_tongue:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":stuck_out_tongue:\"> 600-2\u2019000 mbits). See the Q&amp;A on our website: <a href=\"https://polisystems.ch/en/s3\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Poli Systems - S3 Hosting</a></p>\n<p>Here is a list of our base pricing per month (without commitement) :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 TB 6.59\u20ac</li>\n<li>2 TB 11.19\u20ac</li>\n<li>5 TB 24.79\u20ac</li>\n<li>10 TB 43.79\u20ac</li>\n<li>25 TB 109.29\u20ac</li>\n<li>50 TB 218.59\u20ac</li>\n<li>100 TB 437.09\u20ac</li>\n<li>250 TB 1092.79\u20ac</li>\n<li>500 TB 2185.49\u20ac</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can view more details here: <a href=\"https://polisystems.ch/en/s3\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Poli Systems - S3 Hosting</a></p>\n<p>And you know what? If you buy for one year you get 10% off, two years 15% off, three years 20% off.<br>\nWhich makes the price per TB around 3.49\u20ac per month depending on the plan.</p>\n<p>Some good questions because we are on a hosting forum :</p>\n<p>Q: What is the hardware behind it?<br>\nA: We are using disks from 14TB-18TB in bays of around 60 disks connected at 100 gb/s internally between the two DC\u2019s.<br>\nQ: What happens if a disk breaks?<br>\nA: Your data is directly replicated on another disk. And our team changes the broken disk asap.<br>\nQ: On what is the infrastructure built?<br>\nA: It\u2019s built on OpenStack Swift, that\u2019s also why our S3 API is limited (<a href=\"https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/s3_compat.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/s3_compat.html</a>)</p>\n<p>We are always open to questions!</p>"}
