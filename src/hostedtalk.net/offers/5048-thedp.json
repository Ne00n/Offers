This will be enforced by extending the auction end time to an additional 5 minutes should there be any bids received within the last 5 minutes of the actual auction end time. If another bid is received within the 5 minutes of extended time, the auction will be extended further for another 5 minutes from the time the last bid was placed. The process will continue until no further bids are received for a 5 minute period and the highest and final bidder will win the auction.</li>\n<li>During the auction period, should someone claim the BIN for the domain, it will outbid any existing bids that has been placed thus ending the auction for the domain name instantly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Payment Method:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal (Payment to be made within 24 hours from end of auction. Winner covers PayPal fees, if any.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Domain Transfer Options:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pushed within registrar.</li>\n<li>EPP/AUTH code will be provided to the winner should the winner chooses to have the domain name transferred out to a different registrar.
