Switch Datacenters is a tier-4 classified datacenter and has the following certifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ISO 27001: information security standard</li>\n<li>ISO 14001: a family of standards related to environmental management(pending)</li>\n<li>PCI-DSS Compliant: data protection for credit card transactions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Employees that are present 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge</strong><br>\nWhat makes us so special is that we have good knowledge of all services that we offer.</p>\n<p>We do not have to rely on external factors and have gained a lot of knowledge through our years of experience. We also offer our expertise (at a fixed rate) to help solve your problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Network</strong><br>\nOur network is built with Juniper hardware and is equipped with multiple fiber optic connections.<br>\nThis configuration allows us to offer DDoS protection services.</p>\n<p><strong>DDoS protection</strong><br>\nOur optional DDoS protection service filters on layer 3 + 4, we can filter up to 40 Gbps. Most DDoS-attacks are bought on the internet. 99% percent of the attacks use a UDP-attack which can be blocked on our network. Bigger attacks are mostly done by botnets. By using botnets the attack is much larger and almost impossible to filter. In the case of a botnet attack, we will apply a null route until the attack is stopped.</p>\n<p>Any damage suffered by not meeting our agreements can not be recovered from Access2.IT. DDoS attacks are excluded from our SLA. It is not possible to recover damages from outages caused by DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>We can offer DDoS protection on request.</p>\n<p><strong>Spare parts</strong><br>\nIn the case of hardware failure, a replacement part or server is arranged with the agreed time (SLA).</p>\n<p>When a major failure occurs and the server needs to be replaced, a similar server will be installed and data will be transferred.</p>\n<p>If you make use of spare parts, we will keep a second server and disks available. In the case of a hardware failure the parts or disks can be transferred to the spare server without reconfiguring the server.</p>\n<p>We can offer spare parts on request.</p>\n<p><strong>Remote management</strong><br>\nAll servers are equipped with remote management so that remotely restarting and shutting down becomes possible. This also allows you to remotely install your server.</p>\n<p><strong>SLA Managed</strong><br>\nAccess2.IT can offer the following service level agreements for managing your infrastructure:</p>\n<p>SLA Managed Standard<br>\nBusiness days from 09:00 - 18:00<br>\nResponse time: 24 hours (or the next day)<br>\nIncluded with all services</p>\n<p>SLA Managed Standard &amp; Standby<br>\nUsable: 24x7<br>\nCan be used: 24x7<br>\nResponse time: 24 hours<br>\nMonthly price: \u20ac190</p>\n<p>SLA Managed Expert<br>\nUsable: 24x7<br>\nResponse time: 3 hours<br>\nSolved within: 6 hours<br>\nMonthly price: \u20ac530</p>\n<p>SLA Managed Platinum<br>\nUsable: 24x7<br>\nResponse time: 1 hours<br>\nSolved within: 3 hours<br>\nMonthly price: \u20ac1060</p>\n<p>Our contact details:<br>\nEmail: joeri@access2.it<br>\nPhone: +31 85 401 6336<br>\nSkype: JoeriFrantz</p>\n<p>Company details:<br>\nAccess2.IT Group B.V.<br>\nCura\u00e7aostraat 11, 1339KL Almere<br>\nThe Netherlands<br>\nVAT: NL853006404B01<br>\nCoC: 58365400</p>"}
