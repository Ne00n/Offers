Those who don\u2019t, <a href=\"https://servedez.com/\">ServedEz </a> ,a Nexus Bytes LLC company; a no frills free web hosting provider.</p>\n<p>I/We have been successfully offering free hosting for ~2 years right now.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t ask for donation, nor a bait and switch scheme to get premium upgrades. This, in our opinion, is perfect for hosting personal blogs, CV, small startups, projects etc.</p>\n<p>Please don\u2019t be a dick. Feel free to use it for personal projects. All the usual common sense based rules and regulation applies. I don\u2019t sell your info nor spam you with \u201cupgrades/promotions \u201c). I respect your privacy and you as human. However, during the signup process, you still need to provide real info. Granted I won\u2019t be asking for ID proof but if your name is Ben Dover from 69 BIG ROD st, yeah you won\u2019t be getting activated.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know \u201cUnmetered \u201c storage or data doesn\u2019t exist. You do have to understand that most of the average Joe on the internet, making their first website, they don\u2019t know how things work and we human love to have things in bigger quantities than we actually need. So the idea was to signup for the hosting and use it that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t worry about the nitty-gritty maths to figure out what you need or how much.</p>\n<p>As long as you adhere to the policy (website only content, no resource-hogging/being a dick, etc.) I will bite my tongue and stick to offering \u201cUnmetered \u201c space for your personal project.</p>\n<p>If you plan to use this for the next Facebook/Backupzilla/Imgur, etc. , this is not for you! It is free for a reason and the reason is, a user domain account is limited to qty of 3 for each core features (FTP/subdomain/database/email etc) and support is strictly via the community forum.</p>\n<p>You have all the jazz of usual hosting (Softaculous auto-installer, DA control panel etc). Multiple PHP version/Node.JS/Python Supported.</p>\n<p>Spamming and other BS activities are strictly prohibited and service will be terminated at the first sign of abuse. Multiple product sign ups are welcome. There\u2019s no catch. No bait and switch. I don\u2019t ask for much. Just be a decent human and don\u2019t abuse it :).</p>\n<p><strong>How to order?

However,</li>\n<li>Support for free hosting is limited via our community forum.</li>\n<li>Location : Germany.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usage is monitored and any domain that gets 0 monthly hits or not actively updated (abandoned) after 35 days of no usage gets suspended, followed by a termination of the user don\u2019t response.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.
