Public ones, however, are not.<br>\nQ: What\u2019s your refund policy?<br>\nWe do have a 30-day refund policy for your first service with us.<br>\nQ: What payment methods are accepted?<br>\nWe accept payments via PayPal and BitPay.<br>\nQ: Do you have a test IP/file?<br>\nYes.<br>\nQ: Do you offer instant setup?<br>\nServers on this offer are instantly provisioned, subject to stock availability.<br>\nQ: Why my order was marked as fraud?<br>\nThe usual reason for an order, being marked as fraud is if you place it from a VPN/Server IP. We do not allow such kind of orders, so if you intend to order with a VPN, it will be marked as fraud. If you are on vacation/holiday and live in a different country, please contact us prior to ordering.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Info:</strong><br>\nDallas, USA<br>\nTest IPv4: 192.138.210.63<br>\nTest IPv6: 2604:0880:0052:0000:0000:0000:01e5:657b<br>\nTest file(IPv4): <a href=\"http://lg-dal.ipv4.drserver.net/100MB.test\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://lg-dal.ipv4.drserver.net/100MB.test</a><br>\nLooking glass(IPv4): <a href=\"http://lg-dal.ipv4.drserver.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://lg-dal.ipv4.drserver.net/</a><br>\nTest file(IPv6): <a href=\"http://lg-dal.ipv6.drserver.net/100MB.test\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://lg-dal.ipv6.drserver.net/100MB.test</a><br>\nLooking glass(IPv6): <a href=\"http://lg-dal.ipv6.drserver.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://lg-dal.ipv6.drserver.net/</a></p>\n<p>All network ports have DDoS protection.
