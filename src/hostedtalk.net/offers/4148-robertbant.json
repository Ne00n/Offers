After a long search I come across MXroute and their recently launched reseller plans, so I\u2019ve decided to give it a try and launch a email hosting service using MXroute infrastructure. I\u2019ve launched today on Product Hunt and I\u2019ve already got my first customer. I\u2019m opened to criticism and constructive feedback. This is my first project I\u2019ve decided to share it with the world.</p>\n<p>The plans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Basic</strong><br>\n$0.99/month or $5.99/year<br>\n1 domain<br>\n2 mailboxes<br>\n1 GB of storage<br>\nLive Chat &amp; Ticket Support</p>\n<p><strong>Standard</strong><br>\n$1.49/month or $8.99/year<br>\n1 domain<br>\n4 mailboxes<br>\n2 GB of storage<br>\nLive Chat &amp; Ticket Support</p>\n<p><strong>Pro</strong><br>\n$1.99/month or $11.99/year<br>\nUnlimited domain<br>\nUnlimited mailboxes<br>\n5 GB of storage<br>\nLive Chat &amp; Ticket Support</p>\n<p>You can find more and order the plans on our website <a href=\"https://simplimail.co/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://simplimail.co/</a>.</p>\n<p>The company who operates the website is registered in Europe, Romania.
