Quite often the best path to resolution is to pay someone a lot of money for a fancy service that really isn\u2019t that fancy of a service to provide. On that note, I\u2019m happy to say that we\u2019ve been successful in reaching to all of those recipient services thanks to help from our customers.</p>\n<p>MXroute isn\u2019t just an email host, it\u2019s a movement against the notion that you have to pay top dollar to get your emails where they need to be. You\u2019re not just buying the service, you\u2019re supporting our efforts to keep email simple, reliable, sustainable, and affordable.</p>\n<p>The best part? We don\u2019t charge you per user like the big companies do. We charge you based on the physical storage you want to set aside for your accounts. On that note, I\u2019m happy to annouce the <strong>LARGEST</strong> allocation of space in a yearly promo to date, in an offer you can\u2019t refuse.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Email Accounts</li>\n<li>Unlimited Domains</li>\n<li>300 outbound emails per hour (soft limit)</li>\n<li><strong>100GB of Storage</strong></li>\n<li>$15/year OR</li>\n<li>$25/2years OR</li>\n<li>$30/3years</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=89\">Order now</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>AND back by popular request, a $5 plan!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Email Accounts</li>\n<li>Unlimited Domains</li>\n<li>300 outbound emails per hour (soft limit)</li>\n<li>5GB of storage</li>\n<li>$5/year OR</li>\n<li>$10/2years OR</li>\n<li>$15/3years</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=84\">Order now</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These packages include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SMTP / IMAP / POP3</li>\n<li>Webmail (Roundcube)</li>\n<li>Crossbox</li>\n<li>Custom in-house outbound cluster for high quality delivery (with 3rd party fallback, ex.
