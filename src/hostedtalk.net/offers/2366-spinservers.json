Our motto is to let you \u201c<strong>spin up servers</strong>\u201d fast, seamlessly, and affordably. Here are some of our core features that make us one-of-a-kind:</p>\n<p><strong>Vertically Integrated:</strong>  we are one of the first and only hosting providers to be an integrated hardware reseller. We started as hardware enthusiasts that scavenged for deals on undervalued server equipment coming off-lease. We have come a long way since the \u201890\u2019s; we\u2019re now one of the largest resellers of pre-owned servers on the planet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We own 100% of the servers that are used for hosting. We have full control over quality and specifications.</li>\n<li>Servers are an  <strong>ASSET</strong>  to our business, not an EXPENSE. We pass on tremendous cost savings to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Instantly Deploy the following dedicated server\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>Dual Intel Xeon E5-2630L v2, 12x 2.4GHz  <em>(24x 2.4 GHz with HT)</em><br>\n64GB DDR3 ECC Registered RAM<br>\n2x 800GB Enterprise SSD\u2019s<br>\nLSI 9265-8i RAID w/ Cache &amp; BBU<br>\n10TB Monthly Transfer @ 1Gbps<br>\nAuto-provisions within 30 minutes<br>\n6x Bay 2.5 Inch hot-swap chassis  <strong>(scale on demand)</strong><br>\nJust $90/month with promo code \" <strong>WINWITHUS</strong> \"<br>\n<strong>DEPLOY NOW:</strong>  <a href=\"https://www.spinservers.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=16&amp;promocode=WINWITHUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.spinservers.com/cart.php\u2026code=WINWITHUS</a></p>\n<p>See our dedicated server inventory here: <a href=\"https://www.spinservers.com/dedicated_servers.php\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dedicated Servers - Spin Servers</a></p>\n<p>Don\u2019t see the specs you want?

We provide the exceptionally high level of service, and we use top-tier datacenters.</p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s how your business can win with us:</strong></p>\n<p>We operate our own ASN (AS396073), own our IP space, and use redundant 10Gbps cabling for our servers. If you ever need to upgrade your server to 10Gbps, you can do so within minutes, without needing to add any extra physical components to your server!</p>\n<p><strong>Want to know more?
