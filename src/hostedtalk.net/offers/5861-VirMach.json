If you\u2019ve been a member of HostedTalk for all of 2020, feel free to private message us here as well to get one of these offers if you are not currently a customer.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Offers</strong><br>\n</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <a href=\"https://virmach.com/special-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">VirMach.com | The Best &amp; Cheapest VPS Cloud Hosting</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"\" height=\"\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://virmach.com/special-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Special Offers &amp; Coupon Codes - VirMach.com | The Best &amp; Cheapest VPS...</a></h3>\n\n<p>Special Offers &amp; Coupon Codes Please note: the location you select may be sold out by the time the product is delivered, in which case your order may be canceled.

Please try to order the package you will actually utilize and not just the largest package.</p>\n<p>This <em>will</em> re-occur in most cases by default so just remember to cancel it in advance. We rebill 72 hours in advance before the next term. Please don\u2019t forget to read the special offer terms and our terms of service. Let us know if you have any questions on this thread.</p>\n<p><em>This offer is exclusive for HostedTalk members.</em> We reserve the right to cancel your service (with at least one week\u2019s notice) should we suspect abuse.</p>\n<p>We may ask for a private message to avoid cancellation, thanks for understanding.</p>\n<p>We also have some hardware we can\u2019t really use anymore so we\u2019ll pick out a few people here on this thread and ship them a prize or something so we can complete this parody thread. Probably incorrectly-sized SSDs, an entire older server, flash drives, some random processor, keyboard, maybe the VirMach logo from our office, who knows.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus hint:</strong> if you want to end up maybe getting migrated halfway through the year to a nicer colocated server in a subjectively nicer datacenter with a better network blend, pick Los Angeles.</p>"}
