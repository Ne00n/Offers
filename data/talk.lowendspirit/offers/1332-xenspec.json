Our team is glad to help! We're reachable through our ticketing system, our website's Live Chat, and email at support@xenspec.com\r\n\r\nOur dedicated servers are unmanaged, however we will try to make every attempt to help with any issues that may arise. If we're not able to assist with a certain issue, we'll certainly get you pointed in the right direction. All hardware and network issues are fully covered, custom software and certain operating system issues will be our best effort.\r\n\r\nFor out-of-band access and reboot capabilities, we offer proxied IPMI access. This ensures that the IPMI interface is always secure, and is not accessible when not in use. Creating a session and logging into IPMI can be done within our customer portal, under the service you wish to connect to.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nThank you!"}
