There will be promo codes for Shared, Reseller, Email and Domains and maybe a few bonus packages. What would you like to see?\r\n\r\n---\r\nSmallWeb's got it all. We offer DirectAdmin based services in 8 locations around the world including Amsterdam, Germany, Luxembourg, London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York and Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe recently changed back to having location-based packages to bring back automatic provisioning, service upgrades and to improve customer communication.\r\n\r\n**256MB (\u00bcGB)**\r\n\u00a31.99 GBP/year\r\n\u00bcGB NVMe/SSD\r\n1 Website(s)\r\n100GB Transfer\r\n20EP, 1MB/s I/O\r\nSoftaculous Apps\r\nLet's Encrypt\r\nEmail Disabled\r\n\r\n**512MB (\u00bdGB)**\r\n\u00bdGB NVMe/SSD\r\n1 Website(s)\r\n100GB Transfer\r\n25EP, 5MB/s I/O\r\nSoftaculous Apps\r\nLet's Encrypt\r\nEmail Enabled\r\n\r\n**1GB**\r\n1GB NVMe/SSD\r\n5 Website(s)\r\n100GB Transfer\r\n25EP, 5MB/s I/O\r\nSoftaculous Apps\r\nLet's Encrypt\r\nEmail Enabled\r\n\r\n**2GB**\r\n2GB NVMe/SSD\r\n10 Website(s)\r\n100GB Transfer\r\n25EP, 5MB/s I/O\r\nSoftaculous Apps\r\nLet's Encrypt\r\nEmail Enabled\r\n\r\n[Pick a location here!](https://smallweb.net/order/main/index/budget \"Pick a location here!\")\r\n\r\n![](https://lowendspirit.com/smallweb-advert125.gif  \"\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*We offer 8 locations in total across all of our different service types but not necessarily for each individual service.\r\n\r\nSmallWeb Ltd is registered in England &amp; Wales under company 12272693\r\n&lt;/center&gt;"}
