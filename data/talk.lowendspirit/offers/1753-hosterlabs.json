As many of you know the Mexican Independence Day is approaching and therefore I have decided to celebrate with some quite good offers for you all.\r\n\r\nThese offers include OVH Anti-DDoS , located in Beauharnois, Canada and they are mounted on these nodes:\r\n\r\nIntel Xeon-E 2288G ( 8 Cores / 16 threads ) Max Speed @5Ghz with overclocking.\r\n128GB DDR4 ECC 2666MHz \r\n2 x 1TB NVMe in RAID 0 ( So if one drive fails, data is lost) Nevertheless, we keep remote backups of all servers. You should not trust our backups as much, as we are seeing some failures these days on the system. We are repairing them as of now.\r\n10Gbps Downlink (Bursts)  2Gbps Uplink (Bursts)\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking Glass : Canada.lg.hosterlabs.net\r\n\r\nExcellent connectivity to Europe and the US. \r\n\r\nOffers:\r\n\r\nCPU Intensive Offer\r\n\r\n&gt;RAM: 1 GB\r\n&gt;Space: 25 GB NVMe\r\n&gt;CPU: 3 vCPU (Fair Share)*\r\n&gt;Speed: 1Gbps Unmetered**\r\n&gt;KVM Virtualized\r\n&gt;Price: 7$/Month\r\n&gt; Link : https://hosterlabs.net/panel/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=123\r\n&gt;* Please read https://hosterlabs.net/panel/knowledgebase/37/Do-you-limit-CPU-usage.html\r\n&gt;**Acceptable Use policy\r\n\r\n\r\nLow End Offer\r\n\r\n&gt;RAM:  512MB\r\n&gt;Space: 10GB NVMe\r\n&gt;CPU: 1 vCPU\r\n&gt;Speed: 1Gbps unmetered**\r\n&gt;KVM Virtualized\r\n&gt;Limited Stock\r\n&gt;Pricing: Quarterly at 5$/mo \r\n&gt;Link : https://hosterlabs.net/panel/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=124\r\n&gt;**Acceptable use policy applies.\r\n\r\nNvme High Storage offer:\r\n\r\n&gt;RAM: 1 GB\r\n&gt;Space: 150 GB NVMe\r\n&gt;CPU: 1 vCPU\r\n&gt;Speed: 1Gbps unmetered.**\r\n&gt;KVM Virtualized\r\n&gt;Price: 7$/Month\r\n&gt;Link: https://hosterlabs.net/panel/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=121\r\n&gt;**Acceptable use policy applies.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpcoming offers:\r\nMany IPv4's ( 4 IP's for 7$/month)\r\nRam Intensive nodes ( 8GB of RAM for 7$/month)\r\n\r\nAll of the offers are limited stock, as we do not intend on overselling the nodes. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Acceptable use policy for unmetered bandwidth at 1Gbps:\r\n\r\nWe advertise on some nodes and some plans speeds of 1Gbps, this speed is available to all nodes. We sometimes limit this speed to maintain reliability of the server in case we detect prolonged use of a lot of bandwidth at a very high speed 5+ TB. This limit will never be under 200Mbps. Some variation of the speed is also to be expected, as the nodes have a shared 2Gbps port for Bursts or 1Gbps guaranteed.\r\n"}
