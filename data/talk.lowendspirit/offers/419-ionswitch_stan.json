IonSwitch has expanded to Dallas, Texas, USA and been hosting private workloads out of two Texas data centers for over a year.  We have consolidated down to what we feel is the more robust option at Carrier-1 and have started to open up public VPS hosting.  \r\n\r\nSimilar to our Seattle, Washington site we own all our equipment, IP addresses, network (AS16584) routers, switches and hypervisors.  Multiple upstream carriers and DDOS protection.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n- No outgoing SMTP - my life is too short.\r\n- No BGP at this time. \r\n- No customer referrals for these deals.\r\n- Looking glass isn't up yet -- 204.9.36.6 is a test IP\r\n\r\n**Host Nodes**\r\nE5-2670 (or better) - Same as Seattle.\r\n6 disk RAID10 Enterprise SSD\r\n128GB per hypervisor\r\nDedicated resources per VPS (see KB) - no overselling.  \r\n\r\nWe are offering some early-adopter huge discounts for this site --\r\n\r\nLink: https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=36\r\nCode: LES-2019-12-VPS512DAL - ~~$12/yr~~ $11.50/yr (LES Exclusive!)\r\n```\r\n1 vCore CPU\r\n512MB RAM\r\n5GB RAID 10 SSD Storage\r\n500GB on 1Gbps Port Bandwidth\r\n1 IPv4 (Additional Available w/ Justification) &amp; /64 IPv6 Subnet IP Addresses\r\nKVM Virtualization Type\r\nVirtualizor Control Panel\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink: https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=35\r\nLES-2019-12-VPS1DAL - ~~$20/yr~~ $19/yr (LES Exclusive!)\r\n```\r\n1 vCore CPU\r\n1GB RAM\r\n10GB RAID 10 SSD Storage\r\n1TB on 1Gbps Port Bandwidth\r\n1 IPv4 (Additional Available w/ Justification) &amp; /64 IPv6 Subnet IP Addresses\r\nKVM Virtualization Type\r\nVirtualizor Control Panel\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink: https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=37\r\nLES-2019-12-VPS2DAL - ~~$40/yr~~ $39/yr (LES Exclusive!)\r\n```\r\n2 vCore CPU\r\n2GB RAM\r\n25GB RAID 10 SSD Storage\r\n2TB on 1Gbps Port Bandwidth\r\n1 IPv4 (Additional Available w/ Justification) &amp; /64 IPv6 Subnet IP Addresses\r\nKVM Virtualization Type\r\nVirtualizor Control Panel\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen a support ticket for a free 10GB with the use of any of these `LES-2019-12-*` coupons before the New Year!"}
