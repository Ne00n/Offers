We're happy the way it is - small, profitable, easy to manage.\r\n\r\nSome members here know that I and my girlfriend are expecting our first baby (21 weeks today!), so I've not only launched this promotion to celebrate our anniversary, as to fund a few acquisitions we need for our house to accommodate him - new couch, fridge, and other stuff that parents need. All the funds on this sale will be solely to improve our house. If you'd like to help, get one of these specials, which are all recurring.\r\nNote: This thread was posted on LET, LES and HB.\r\n(The DE server will be migrated to a Ryzen next Sunday!)\r\n\r\nCoupons, first come first served:\r\n\r\n**HIBOY** - 5 Coupons, Reseller Entry, paid annually for 40\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n**HAPPYDAY** - 5 Coupons, Reseller Advanced, paid annually for 80\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n**LILMIKE** - 10 Coupons, Shared Basic, paid annually for 20\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n**PRESIDENT** - 10 Coupons, Shared Pro, paid annually for 40\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n**CRAZYBASTARD** - 2 Coupons, Reseller Entry, paid annually for 30\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n**CRAZYMIKE** - 2 Coupons, Reseller Advanced, paid annually for 60\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n**COUCH** - 30 Coupons, Shared Basic, paid annually for 25\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n**FRIDGE** - 20 Coupons, Shared Basic, paid annually for 45\u20ac - 1 per client (new or existing clients, can't be used to replace existing services)\r\n\r\nPlans we have available:\r\n\r\n**Shared Hosting plans:**\r\n\r\nBasic\r\n25GB SSD\r\nUnmetered Bandwidth\r\nUnlimited Domains\r\n[ORDER NOW](https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=8 \"ORDER NOW\")\r\nLocations: DE &amp; LA\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic\r\n50GB SSD\r\nUnmetered Bandwidth\r\nUnlimited Domains\r\n[ORDER NOW](https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=9 \"ORDER NOW\")\r\nLocations: DE &amp; LA\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reseller Hosting plans:**\r\n\r\nEntry\r\n50GB SSD\r\nUnmetered Bandwidth\r\nUnlimited Accounts\r\n[ORDER NOW](https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=6 \"ORDER NOW\")\r\nLocations: DE &amp; LA\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvanced\r\n100GB SSD\r\nUnmetered Bandwidth\r\nUnlimited Accounts\r\n[ORDER NOW](https://myw.pt/manager/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=7 \"ORDER NOW\")\r\nLocations: DE &amp; LA\r\n\r\n\r\nCloudLinux limits:\r\n\r\n200% CPU\r\n2GB RAM\r\n4096 IOPs\r\n10MB/s Disk\r\n50 Entry Processes\r\n200 Processes\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"}
