No exception. Controlled environment, with tight access to what's needed to do the job and period;\r\n- 24/7 Support by the end of the year if all goes well;\r\n- All employees will be trained by me;\r\n- Billingual support: Portuguese &amp; English, though we're also able to read Spanish &amp; Italian;\r\n\r\nOur plans start for 200\u20ac/mo and include 200 tickets, these are billed per shift, so that'll be 10AM to 6PM (GMT +0), Mon-Fri. In the future, I hope to expand this to 24/7 as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI have worked for plenty of companies, to name a few:\r\n- VirMach, for over a year as a L3 Senior System Administrator;\r\n- Tapatalk, for over 5 years as their Cloud Architect in AWS and Senior Administrator (joined there when we had 2 employees, left when the company was acquired by a giant VC);\r\n- ServerMania, a few months there, excellent company to work for;\r\n- tmzVPS;\r\n- Grindr, for a few months as a Senior System Administrator/Cloud Architect, we managed over 70 people there;\r\n- HostSolutions (present, as a Senior System Administrator);\r\n- Superior-Host (present, for a few years already, as a Senior System Administrator);\r\n- More. Maybe yours?\r\n\r\nWe hate the back and forth on the tickets. Speedy and effective responses - [Hire us](https://myw.pt/whitelabelsupport \"Hire us\").\r\n\r\nhttps://myw.pt/whitelabelsupport"}
