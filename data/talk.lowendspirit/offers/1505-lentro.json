Thought I might give a shameless promo for you all to become FluidStack providers too. \r\n\r\n\r\n## **What is FluidStack?**\r\n\r\n* We are like an Airbnb but for GPU servers. **You host your machine(s), we rent them, and our customers use them for machine learning, CAD rendering, etc.** \r\n* We are backed by some original investors of SpaceX, Revolut, and Transferwise\r\n\r\nOur virtual desktop platform is growing fast, and we need more providers! \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n##**How it works:**\r\n1. Fill out a quick application form **[here to become a supplier](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZO04k2H8NvbaZu43OWq8bekkvbrHvELh2ZOwZfATt4wnZWA/viewform \"here\")**\r\n2. Once approved, follow 5 minute setup instructions to give us access to your fully dedicated machine\r\n3. Sit back and relax. We rent the machine, and you get **guaranteed monthly payouts** even if it\u2019s not always used!\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n##**Payouts**\r\nPayouts made at start of each month via PayPal. We solely pay for the GPU; we do not compensate for CPU/RAM/bandwidth. If I included rates for all supported GPUs, it would go on forever, so I'm just including two examples. Payout rates for _your_ GPU can be seen after [approved](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZO04k2H8NvbaZu43OWq8bekkvbrHvELh2ZOwZfATt4wnZWA/viewform \"approved\"). \r\n\r\nCurrent Per-GPU payout:\r\nNIVIDA Tesla V100: $310/month\r\nNVIDIA GeForce 2080 Ti: $90/month\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n##**Frequently Asked Questions**\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements? \r\n* **Fully dedicated machine** with 8+ GB of RAM, 200 GB of disk space, 5+ Mbps guaranteed bandwidth\r\n* NVIDIA GPU including: a100, v100, 2080ti, 2080 Super, 2080, 2070 Super, 2070, 2060 Super, 2060, 1080 Ti, 1080, 1070, 1070 Ti, 1060 6GB, 1060 3GB, 1050 Ti, or 1050\r\n* Windows or Linux\r\n* Virtualization and IOMMU support\r\n* SSH access\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity?\r\n* We do our best to keep providers secure: happy providers = more GPUs = larger business. If you are hosting a machine from your home, understand that someone else will have access. Personally, I would suggest firewalling LAN addresses and patching CPU vulnerabilities just in case.\r\n\r\nNotes?\r\n* V100 and 2080/Ti/Supers have the fastest waiting lists (few days) - others might take a bit longer\r\n* Tampering or excessive downtime will result in no payouts\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n##**Need Affordable GPU Servers?**\r\n\r\nRent machines with GPUs from virtually anywhere in the world [here](https://www.fluidstack.io/virtual_desktop/ \"here\")\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n##**Closing Notes**\r\n\r\n**Whether you want to become a provider or a customer, there has never been a better time to join!**\r\n\r\nPost questions that benefit everyone down below, and contact us at [sales@fluidstack.io](mailto:sales@fluidstack.io \"sales@fluidstack.io\") for individual/private inquiries.
