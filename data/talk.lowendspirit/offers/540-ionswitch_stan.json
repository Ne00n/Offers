We've been operating out of our flagship Seattle location since we started, and just added Dallas a year ago with public sales starting last month.   \r\n\r\nWe constantly pickup votes on the _Provider of the Year_ awards.\r\n\r\nWe are offering 20% off reoccurring monthly rates with the code **LET2020-JAN-20PCTOFF**.\r\n\r\nJanuary Special:  Double Storage (up to 20GB) on any VPS purchase.  Just open a support case and reference this offer.  \r\n\r\n**Terms**\r\n- [No SMTP](https://clients.ionswitch.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=3) unless you super-promise not to SPAM, and are sending at a low rate (&lt;50 emails a day). \r\n- Free BGP on annual purchases (currently Seattle only)\r\n- All offers stack with our annual 17% off (two month free) for even MORE savings [excl. VPS512].\r\n- We want you to be happy.  We have a clear refund policy in our Terms of Service, but with a reasonable discussion we can generally work out pro-rated refunds where needed beyond that window.  I've never said \"no\" to a reasonable request.\r\n- Every VPS has a dedicated CPU allocation [as defined in our knowledge base](https://clients.ionswitch.com/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/5/CPU-Resource-Policy.html).  This ensures we do not over-sell our systems.  \r\n\r\n**Table 'o Offers**\r\n\r\n| Location | Product | vCPU | Memory | Disk | Bandwidth | Price |\r\n|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\r\n| Dallas | VPS512 | 1 | 512MB | 8GB | 1/2T | [$14/yr](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=36)\r\n| Dallas | VPS1 | 1 | 1024MB | 10GB | 1T | [$2.80/m](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=35)\r\n| Dallas | VPS2 | 2 | 2048MB | 25GB | 2T | [$5.60/m](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=37)\r\n| Seattle | VPS512 | 1 | 512MB | 8GB | 1/2T | [$14/yr](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=13)\r\n| Seattle | VPS1 | 1 | 1024MB | 10GB | 1T | [$2.80/m](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1)\r\n| Seattle | VPS2 | 2 | 2048MB | 25GB | 2T | [$5.60/m](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3)\r\n| Seattle | NVME512 | 1 | 512MB | 8GB | 1/2T | [$18/yr](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=23)\r\n| Seattle | NVME1 | 1 | 1024MB | 10GB | 1T | [$3.6/m](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=20)\r\n\r\n**Annual Dallas Deals**\r\n\r\nI still have a limited number of discounts for Annual purchases in Dallas with coupons:\r\n\r\n| Product | Price | Coupon |\r\n|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|\r\n| Dallas VPS1 | $20/yr | LET-2019-12-VPS1DAL\r\n| Dallas VPS2 | $40/yr | LET-2019-12-VPS2DAL\r\n| Dallas VPS4-16 | $etc/yr | contact me\r\n\r\n**Colo, SIX Links, etc**\r\n\r\nIonswitch offers direct 1Gb/s and 10Gb/s connections to the SeattleIX, colocation in Dallas and Seattle on our multiple 10Gb/s dedicated networks, and IP rentals.  \r\n\r\n**Server Management/Migrations**\r\n\r\nIonSwitch offers server management, migrations (in, and our of our platform), systems automation (Puppet, Ansible, Chef), and consulting both on a reoccuring and emergency basis.\r\n\r\n**Want to chat?**\r\n\r\nIonSwitch is on the LET Discord, and we operate our own [Discord](https://discord.gg/6b42yr)."}
