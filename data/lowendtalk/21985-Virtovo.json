Virtovo is a very young company and doesn't have a long story to tell. We are committed to writing a successful story going forward through good quality hardware and a commitment to customer service.  \r\n\r\nWe currently only offer services out of Coresite, Miami. IPv6 is available in this location but IPv6 is not currently offered with these plans. We are investigating the best way to allocate /64s to customers instead of fragmented addresses which SolusVM allocates by default. We hope to have a solution to this before the end of February.  \r\n\r\nWe use Blesta for our billing/support and SolusVM for our VPS control.  \r\n\r\n**Node specifications**  \r\n* Dual E5-2620v2 (2.1Ghz)  \r\n* 128GB RAM  \r\n* Minimum 8 Disk LSI Raid 10 Array  \r\n* Redundant 1Gbps uplinks at the node level  \r\n\r\n**Please find the below benchmark shared by of our clients:**  \r\n\r\n    CPU model :  QEMU Virtual CPU version (cpu64-rhel6)\r\n    Number of cores : 6\r\n    CPU frequency :  2099.998 MHz\r\n    Total amount of ram : 2016 MB\r\n    Total amount of swap : 0 MB\r\n    System uptime :   1 min,\r\n    Download speed from CacheFly: 45.5MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Coloat, Atlanta GA: 13.0MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Softlayer, Dallas, TX: 38.0MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Linode, Tokyo, JP: 9.45MB/s\r\n    Download speed from i3d.net, Rotterdam, NL: 8.32MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Leaseweb, Haarlem, NL: 10.5MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Softlayer, Singapore: 6.39MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Softlayer, Seattle, WA: 20.6MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Softlayer, San Jose, CA: 18.5MB/s\r\n    Download speed from Softlayer, Washington, DC: 51.2MB/s\r\n    I/O speed :  782 MB/s\r\n\r\n**Important info**  \r\n[Terms of service ](http://www.virtovo.com/tos.html)  \r\n[Acceptable use policy](http://www.virtovo.com/aup.html)  \r\n[Privacy policy](http://www.virtovo.com/privacy.html)  \r\n[Public Status](http://status.virtovo.com/)  \r\n\r\n**Test IP/Files**  \r\nmia.virtovo.com  \r\n[http://mia.virtovo.com/100MB.zip  ](http://mia.virtovo.com/100MB.zip)  \r\n[http://mia.virtovo.com/1GB.zip  ](http://mia.virtovo.com/1GB.zip)  \r\n\r\nWe're offering a very special recurring discount offer on our 2GB KVM plan.
