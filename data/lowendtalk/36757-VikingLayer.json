Our aim is to provide affordable and high performance virtual servers. We've come up with two exclusive offers for LET/LEB.\r\n\r\nWe've set a large focus on DDoS-Protection and that's the reason why we chose OVH Roubaix as our first location. Our nodes have their Anti-DDoS Pro service enabled, wich has some extra features over the normal service, one being permanent mitigation. This means that our servers are perfect for customers running services at risk of attacks (Ex. Game or Voice Servers).\r\n\r\n**SPECIAL - FIRST MONTH FREE!
