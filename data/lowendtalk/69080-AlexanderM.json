HostUS is owned and operated by HostUS Solutions LLC, and we are a registered LLC in Delaware, USA. We are long established, having provided hosting services since 2012.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone that voted for us in the most recent LowEndTalk provider poll! Coming in 9th meant a lot to me, and to the team at HostUS. It's with that showing and the good reception of our Hong Kong product launch earlier this year that I am happy to announce....&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b style=\"margin:auto\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;London as our 5th location&lt;/u&gt;, which is also our first step in expanding across Europe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nBut... it does not stop there!&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;London we've turbo-charged for the speed freaks. We are providing a &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;shared 10Gbps connection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to every VPS in London. Yes, up to TEN gigabits per second in every VPS container (fair use of course).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;To further sweeten the deal, all London VPS include &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;FREE Basic DDoS Protection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This location is &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;protected from DDoS attacks up to 20Gbps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with on-network protection provided by Arbor TMS hardware.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;We've put some big iron behind the new UK launch. London is running on Dual Xeon E5 v3 CPUs. These big CPUs are bundled with plenty of DDR4 RAM, hardware RAID 10, and SSD caching.\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\nAll offer prices listed below are recurring discount. We guarantee that the price will not change for the life of your service. We do not require a contract for our VPS services. You will never be forced into a contract to take advantage of our unbeatable combination, of low prices and superior service.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAll OpenVZ VPS users get access to our in-house created Breeze Control Panel for power controls, OS reloads, statistics, rDNS settings, console, advanced security settings and more.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;HostUS UK Introductory Special Offers:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\n    UK Special \u2013 768MB\r\n    768MB DDR4 RAM\r\n    768MB vSwap\r\n    20GB SSD-Cached Disk Space\r\n    1 vCPU Core (Fair Share)\r\n    2TB (2000GB) Bandwidth @ 10Gbps\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    4x IPv6 addresses\r\n    OpenVZ / Breeze Control Panel\r\n    $15/year\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://is.gd/1NhpXM\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Order Now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n    UK Special \u2013 2GB\r\n    2GB DDR4 RAM\r\n    2GB vSwap\r\n    75GB SSD-Cached Disk Space\r\n    4 vCPU Cores (Fair Share)\r\n    2TB (2000GB) Bandwidth @ 10Gbps\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    6x IPv6 addresses\r\n    OpenVZ / Breeze Control Panel\r\n    $48/year or $15/quarter\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://is.gd/En2k2P\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Order Now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n    UK Special \u2013 6GB\r\n    6GB DDR4 RAM\r\n    6GB vSwap\r\n    150GB SSD-Cached Disk Space\r\n    4 vCPU Cores (Fair Share)\r\n    5TB (5000GB) Bandwidth @ 10Gbps\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    6x IPv6 addresses\r\n    OpenVZ / Breeze Control Panel\r\n    $21/quarter\r\n    \r\n&lt;a href=\"http://is.gd/fxi4fG\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Order Now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Available License Addons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nHostUS is now a cPanel NOC partner and WHMCS partner, offering discounted licenses as part of our VPS hosting offerings.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n    cPanel/WHM VPS License: $12/month\r\n    WHMCS Branded: $9/month\r\n    WHMCS Unbranded: $12/month\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Network Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: London (Docklands), United Kingdom&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTest IPv4: 185.122.56.3&lt;br&gt;\r\nTest IPv6: 2a06:8ec0:3::1:749f&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nLooking Glass: http://lon-lg.hostus.us&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNetwork Connectivity: Level3, Zayo, Cogent, LINX (Peering)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe offer IPv4 and IPv6 rDNS right from the Breeze Control Panel.
