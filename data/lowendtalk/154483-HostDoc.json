Not only is it unsustainable, but, I also admitted in the title it is clickbait.\r\n\r\nMoving on...\r\n\r\n5 More Days To Christmas and we here at HostDoc are extremely excited.\r\nWe have slowly been rolling out the ability to offer /64 IPv6 subnets thanks to reasonable DC's who understand a /64 for a reseller host is simply not adequate nor sufficient.\r\nWe have also introduced our new look website, finally updated our terms of service, added a splash of colour to our clients area and have a new logo (but our mascot is still ever present ;) ).\r\n\r\n**Why Choose HostDoc?**\r\nWith HostDoc, we will take care of all your hosting ailements and provide a treatment guaranteed to provide solid uptime, sustainable performance, and most importantly, support  that actually takes into account your needs and wants and strives to deliver a solution as soon as is possible.\r\nYes, we are still a young company, but our track record thus far speaks volumes of what you can expect being a client of our's.\r\nWe are a UK registered limited company, VAT registered and in compliance with ICO's regulations on customer data and privacy.\r\nALL of our VPS offerings are KVM virtualisation ensuring you the best possible control over your VM, bare metal stability and performance.\r\nWe utilise nothing but enterprise hardware such as E3v5/v6 and E5 1650v3.
