We're providing **Pay As You Go VPN accounts** where you purchase a set amount of data, and then take as long as you like using it until the data has ran out.\r\n\r\n**Current PAYG packages:** \r\n\r\n* 10GB bandwidth - \u00a32\r\n* 30GB bandwidth - \u00a33\r\n* 50GB bandwidth - \u00a34\r\n* 100GB bandwidth - \u00a35\r\n\r\n**[ORDER LINK](https://www.vpn.sh/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=14)**\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Locations:**\r\n  \r\n**Share your bandwidth across 17 locations**\r\n\r\n&gt;* USA x5 (Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, Florida, Indiana)\r\n&gt;* Germany x2 (Frankfurt, Dusseldorf)\r\n&gt;* Canada\r\n&gt;* UK\r\n&gt;* Italy\r\n&gt;* Switzerland\r\n&gt;* Estonia\r\n&gt;* Iceland\r\n&gt;* Netherlands\r\n&gt;* Moldova\r\n&gt;* New Zealand\r\n&gt;* Singapore\r\n\r\n**VPN Features**:\r\n\r\n&gt;* PPTP\r\n&gt;* L2TP/IPSec\r\n&gt;* OpenVPN\r\n&gt;* Only your bandwidth usage is logged, so to keep users on the right packages\r\n&gt;* Ability to use on multiple devices (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and more)\r\n&gt;* We accept PayPal, Google Checkout and Debit/Credit Cards (Stripe)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**[ORDER LINK](https://www.vpn.sh/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=14)**\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n&gt;* Visit our [Website](http://www.vpn.sh)\r\n&gt;* Like us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/vpndotsh)\r\n&gt;* Follow us on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/vpnsh)\r\n  \r\n_NOTE: Offers have been discussed with Liam and Infinity, and have been approved, despite not being VPS offers. Comments and suggestions on these plans are welcome, as they're still in the early stages. Please note that this isn't for a monthly renewal or anything similar. You don't need to pay anything else until your bandwidth allotment has been consumed, and then you can \"top-up\" by purchasing some add-on bandwidth._"}
