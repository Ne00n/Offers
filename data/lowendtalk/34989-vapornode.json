I picked up the license a few months ago and no longer have a need for it. Trust me...if I did have a need for it, I'd keep it. Blesta is a solid piece of software.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am looking for $160 for this license. Support and updates are valid until July 4, 2015.\r\n\r\nWith the release of version 3.3 adding a ton of new stuff, this is quite the deal.\r\n\r\nPM me if you're interested."}
