I haven't checked but I think the specs are a lot better than whats available at the moment.\r\n \r\n**The renewal amount is 34.81 euros / annum**. I love the vps and quality is unmatchable, not renewing it only because I am trying to cut down on my expenses from ordering a gazillion vpses!\r\n\r\nThe specs are\r\n\r\n&gt;IPv4 Address \t1 \t\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;IPv6 Address \t2\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Bandwidth \t1.95 TB\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Disk Space \t120 GB \t\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Memory \t1 GB\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Virtualization Type \t(Xen PV)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Swap \t512 MB\r\n&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n**The first one to pm me with at least an year old membership at lowendtalk gets the vps transferred. \r\n**\r\nNote: you must fulfill all the requirements of transfer according to prometeus tos which I guess requires you to have an exisiting prometeus account ( contact them for details before pming me). + you will be required to extend the vps by paying the annual dues instantly after transfer. If I do not get any replies by tomorrow, I will cancel the vps."}
