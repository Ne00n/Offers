And we launched about a  year ago on June 25th, 2014. As it's our birthday we have made a decision to cut all out prices in half, and the lovely people of LowEndTalk will be the first that have the chance to use these. Our servers are great for people who are looking for learning the basics of Linux CLI, hosting their own blogs or websites and even for game-servers. Our knowledgable and kind support team will be there to guide you every step of the way and provide you with assistance to insure that your services are running smoothly, all of the time.\r\n\r\nWe currently provide services in Germany, France and Canada!\r\n\r\n\r\n**OVZ Tiny**  \r\n1 GB of RAM  \r\n2 Cores (i7 4470)  \r\n50 GB HDD RAID 1 Storage  \r\n500GB of Bandwidth  \r\n$3 a month - [DE]/[CA]  \r\nLink: https://ssl.nanobit.pro/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1    \r\n\r\n\r\n**OVZ Small**  \r\n2 GB of RAM  \r\n3 Cores (i7 4470)  \r\n100 GB HDD RAID 1 Storage  \r\n1TB of Bandwidth  \r\n$4.50 a month - [DE]/[CA]  \r\nLink: https://ssl.nanobit.pro/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3    \r\n\r\n**KVM Tiny**  \r\n512 MB of RAM  \r\n1 Cores (i7 4470)  \r\n20 GB HDD RAID 1 Storage  \r\n1TB of Bandwidth  \r\n$4.50 a month - [FR]  \r\nLink: https://ssl.nanobit.pro/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=19    \r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope to have you as our customer!    \r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,  \r\nThe Nanobit.pro Team"}
