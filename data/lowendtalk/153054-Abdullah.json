Note: we\u2019ll likely not be doing anything crazy for Black Friday since we\u2019d rather maintain the quality.\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nBase plan:\r\n1 CPU core\r\n1 GB RAM\r\n1 TB RAID-50 storage\r\n2 TB bandwidth\r\nStockholm &amp; Los Angeles\r\n$5 per month&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nAdditions: \r\nPlain storage per 1 TB - $4\r\n1 GB RAM + 1 TB storage + 2 TB bandwidth - $5\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ:\u2028\r\nIs this plan available in Amsterdam?\r\nNot at the moment, and will likely be a while before it is.\r\n\r\nIs private networking available?\r\nYes, and it works seamlessly with our NVMe servers so you can combine both as needed.\r\n\r\nCan I add more storage/resources after 31st October?\u2028\r\nYes, as long as you have an active base plan server. It also depends on availability and may not be possible.\r\n\r\nHow to order?\r\nLogin to manage.hosthatch.com, top up the appropriate amount and open a sales ticket with the location you need. (Opening an emergency ticket will unfortunately result in a refund at our discretion with no further possibility of signing up for this plan)\r\n\r\nCan I customise this plan in an X way, to make it cheaper, or exchange one resource with another?\r\nNo, this is not possible.\r\n\r\nCan I get a smaller amount of storage for X price?\r\nNo, this is not possible.\r\n\r\nIt is already over 31st October, can I order this plan?\r\nNo, we will likely make it available at another time again, please keep an eye out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks guys!"}
