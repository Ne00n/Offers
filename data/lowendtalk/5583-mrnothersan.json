I realise the specs aren't great but it's in a great datacenter.\r\n\r\nIt's an [i3-2100](http://cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i3-2100+%40+3.10GHz&amp;id=749), 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD Dell server, practically brand new. It's \u00a3400 new and is literally brand new and has only been co-lo'd for a week or so and that's when the box was opened.\r\n\r\nIf anybody is interested, please post here and I'll drop you a PM with more details. The colocation is in a 12 month contract so that would have to be transferred over to the buyer. The contract was initiated in July of this year. It's in a Tier 3 DC with the cheapest co-lo prices I've seen. The network it's on is fantastic.\r\n\r\nBuyer would rent server from me until colo contract is up.\r\n\r\nThank you."}
