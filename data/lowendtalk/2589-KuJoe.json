We also have some new security in place so that DDOS attacks will no longer impact other clients on the network (good timing right?) so no need to worry about sharing a node with \"bad neighbors\".\r\n\r\nLooking for a place to park your IRC client? Grab one of our O32 or O64 plans and get $2 off (recurring) using the promotion code: **IRCME**\r\n\r\n**O32** - 32MB/64MB RAM, 2GB Disk, 100GB Bandwidth, 1 IPv4 Address, 1 CPU Core = **$11.90/YEAR**\r\n**O64** - 64MB/128MB RAM, 3GB Disk, 100GB Bandwidth, 1 IPv4 Address, 1 CPU Core = **$13.90/YEAR**\r\n\r\nInterested in another plan or service instead?
