We've decided to compliment our managed offerings with some unmanaged lineups, starting with a range of [storage VMs](https://console.vmspecialist.com/order/main/packages/order/?group_id=5 \"storage VMs\").\r\n\r\nYou'll still get 24/7 support and a 99.999% SLA but the day to day running of the VM is down to yourself. Although we can offer one off setups (such as custom NextCloud install using your own domain) for a small one off fee.\r\n\r\nThese are self/unmanaged KVM and are based in Hetzners Finland DC (test IP hel.icmp.hetzner.com or 95.217.255.81).\r\n\r\n**Storage 0.5TB**\r\n\r\n* 1 core\r\n* 1GB ECC RAM\r\n* 0.5TB (512GB) HDD\r\n* 3TB monthly transfer\r\n* 1 x IPv4 address\r\n* ~~\u00a35.00~~ \u00a33.33 ($4.31 as of today) per month with coupon LET33\r\n* [Order](https://console.vmspecialist.com/order/config/index/order/?group_id=5&amp;pricing_id=64 \"Order\")\r\n\r\n**Storage 1TB**\r\n\r\n* 1 core\r\n* 1GB ECC RAM\r\n* 1TB HDD\r\n* 5TB monthly transfer\r\n* 1 x IPv4 address\r\n* ~~\u00a37.50~~ \u00a35 ($6.47 as of today) per month with coupon LET33\r\n* [Order](https://console.vmspecialist.com/order/config/index/order/?group_id=5&amp;pricing_id=66 \"Order\")\r\n\r\nThe coupon also works on our [Storage 2TB](https://console.vmspecialist.com/order/config/index/order/?group_id=5&amp;pricing_id=68 \"Storage 2TB\") (2c/2gb/2tb) bringing it down to \u00a38.33 ($10.77) per month but I'm aware this is over the LET rules. Mods please advise if this line needs removing.\r\n\r\nWe can do custom or higher spec plans if required - please just ask. Coupons are limited and please add your LES username to the additional info field in the checkout. Annual payment gives 12 months for 10 giving a lower monthly equivilant price.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR [terms](https://www.vmspecialist.com/terms.html \"terms\")**\r\n\r\n* No torrenting/anything likely to be classed as copyright infringement.\r\n* No IRC/other services likely to attract DDoS attacks (we may make exceptions depending on use case).\r\n* No CPU intensive workloads (crypto, etc). If you're encoding please contact us and we'll look at whether it will have a negative effect on other users.\r\n* No SPAM\r\n\r\nAll prices exclude VAT where applicable. Orders are manually approved/checked/etc. We also have a small range of fully managed [dedicated servers](https://console.vmspecialist.com/order/main/packages/order/?group_id=4 \"dedicated servers\") which can be configured to include cPanel or DirectAdmin included - or custom setup for your needs.\r\nUSD rates checked with Google today (04/10/20)\r\n\r\nThanks :)"}
