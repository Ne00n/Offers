For backup, I've been using backup-spot.com, but I am running out of space. Rather than upgrade I wanted to get storage elsewhere. I see offers here for backup VPSs. Do they typically come with a panel? Backup-spot installs cPanel, and you can ftp all your Virtualmin backups. If the backup VPS does not come with a panel, I am willing to try one if someone would point me in the right direction to convert one into a ftp backup server.\r\n\r\n"}
