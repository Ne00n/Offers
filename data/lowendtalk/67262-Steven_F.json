In addition, the network is designed to better cope with the stress of DDoS attacks. Sometimes, leaks occur, and in facilities with native protection, you'll see higher end gear that is able to cope with these leaks better. This results in less null routing and higher uptime!&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**Who is the Los Angeles and Dallas mitigation from?**&lt;br&gt;\r\nPsychz provides our top-notch Los Angeles and Dallas DDoS mitigation and scrubbing. They utilize a mixture of NSFOCUS and internal filtering to provide highly efficient and effective scrubbing. On top of their amazing filtering, they boast a massive network in each location utilizing some of the highest quality carriers around.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**Who is the New Jersey and Miami mitigation from?**&lt;br&gt;\r\nChoopa provides the mitigation in New Jersey and Miami. They use a completely in-house system that has proven highly effective and extremely accurate. Choopa is also regarded as having one of the best networks on the east coast, out performing all others!&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**How much mitigation does each VPS get?**&lt;br&gt;\r\nEach node has 10 Gbps of DDoS mitigation shared between all of the VPS. Usually, DDoS attacks are short (&lt;30 minutes) and just a few Gbps, allowing multiple clients access to the scrubbing, with additional capacity in-case of some of those larger attacks. The amount of packets per second varies between our mitigation vendors between 2 Mpps and as high as 10 Mpps!&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**Do your OVZ VPS now include DDoS mitigation?**&lt;br&gt;\r\nNo! Only our KVM VPS include DDoS mitigation!&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**Do you have any test IPs? (Mitigation is not active on these IPs, they will be nulled.)**&lt;br&gt;\r\nLos Angeles Test IPv4: 104.149.18.203&lt;br&gt;\r\nDallas Test IPv4: 45.34.12.147&lt;br&gt;\r\nPiscataway Test IPv4: 206.221.176.194&lt;br&gt;\r\nMiami Test IPv4: 104.243.47.102"}
