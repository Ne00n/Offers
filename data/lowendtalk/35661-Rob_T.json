This new system, developed exclusively for Versaweb, actively monitors our entire network for DoS attacks. When an attack is detected, our system will automatically export a null route to our upstream bandwidth providers, stopping the attack in it\u2019s tracks. Only traffic destined for the IP being attacked is dropped, thereby protecting the rest of our network.  \r\n  \r\nFor users that need a greater level of protection, we also offer Enterprise DoS Protection + Mitigation.
