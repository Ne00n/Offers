Are you looking to move your website to a VPS as it has grown too big for Shared Hosting?\r\nUse VPSCreed now and see the difference. With Free Managed Services, you will not feel the difference in support but surely you will see the difference in performance.\r\n\r\nBefore I go ahead with our announcement, and though VPSCreed requires no introduction, I would still like to give a short intro of ourselves for the WHT members who are still looking for that reliablility and perfomance in their VPS that they deserve. \r\n\r\nIn the Hosting industry, though there are thousands of providers who offer VPS, only a select few do provide the \r\nenterprise level service that every single VPS owner deserves.\r\n\r\nI'm glad to announce that VPSCreed has taken a great leap forward to join this Elite Club. Though our offerings and services match the level of these few providers, what will be the striking feature of our service is listed below.\r\nA Free Management Contract with all our Services.\r\nHigh Performance SSD Disks on RAID for lightning speed websites.\r\nDaily Remote Backups for the safety of your data.\r\n\r\n**The Announcement:**\r\nWe are proud to launch our SSD Based VPS Hosting Service.\r\n\r\nPerformance Benchmark for our German SSD Nodes:\r\n\r\nDrive Performance of a VPS on a Averagely Loaded Node -\r\n---\r\n# dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=64k count=16k conv=fdatasync\r\n16384+0 records in\r\n16384+0 records out\r\n1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 1.32489 s, 810 MB/s\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Network Latency from Europe:**\r\n---\r\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 13.055/13.855/15.343/1.057 ms\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Network Latency from Central US:**\r\n---\r\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 120.106/122.300/123.883/1.651 ms\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Network Latency from Asia (India):**\r\n---\r\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 145.844/147.295/150.357/1.808 ms\r\n---\r\n\r\n**THE SUPER DEAL: (Valid Till 10th Jan)**\r\n\r\n[Use Coupon Code while ordering for EU SSD VPS: VPS50OFF]\r\n=&gt; 50% FLAT Recurring Discount on our Germany VPS Product Line except cPanel Managed Plans \r\n---------------------\r\n[Use Coupon code while ordering for US VPS : VPS50OFF] + [Open a ticket after ordering for the FREE DOUBLE RAM UPGRADE]\r\n=&gt; 50% FLAT Recurring OFF + Double RAM Free Upgrade only on all USA OpenVZ plans\r\n\r\n=&gt; 50% Off for KVM - KVMPRO50\r\n\r\n====================================\r\n**Managed Linux SSD VPS [Germany]**\r\n\r\nSSD G L-0 Disk Space : 20 GB Dedicated Ram : 1 GB CPU Allocation : 2x Cores Bandwidth : 500 GB Price : $ 10.99 Price after Discount: $5.49/mo [ORDER](http://www.vpscreed.com/base_ssd_vps_de.php)\r\n\r\n================================\r\n\r\n**Managed Linux VPS [USA]**\r\n\r\nSATA U L-0 Disk Space : 40 GB Dedicated Ram : 1 GB CPU Allocation : 2x Cores Bandwidth : 500 GB Price after Discount: $5.49/mo [ORDER in USA (+Double RAM)](http://www.vpscreed.com/base_vps_us.php)\r\n\r\n\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\n**KVM PLAN**\r\n\r\nKVM L-1 256 MB RAM 10 GB Storage 1 x 2.7 GHz CPU 150 GB Monthly Traffic Price after discount : $5.49/mo [Order Link](http://www.vpscreed.com/kvm_base_vps_de.php)\r\n\r\nInstant VPS Setup on Payment Extra IPs Available Full Root Access Choice of multiple Linux Flavors Windows OS available for KVM Line Unlimited OS Reloads &amp; Reboots SolusVM Control Panel TUN/TAP Free management contract 99.99% Uptime Guaranteed Secondary Disks in KVM Line Remote VNC\r\n==========================================\r\nPayment Methods : Paypal, Moneybookers, CCAvenue\r\n\r\nSome Great VPSCreed Reviews: ![]([LowEndTalk](http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/9871/review-about-vpscreed)) [Other Reviews](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1175935) Our Review Section\r\n\r\n**Location: Germany, USA**\r\n\r\nSales: sales@vpscreed.com Support: support@vpscreed.com You can also open a Ticket Visit Our Website : www.vpscreed.com"}
