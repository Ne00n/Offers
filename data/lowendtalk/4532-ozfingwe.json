The plans below are an excerpt of available low end plans, and we have created discount codes applicable to those plans for those who want to go for quarterly payments at least (one code per order, expires Sep 6, 2012): \r\n\r\nQuarterly, 10% off: LET10MQ\r\nSemi-Annually, 20% off: LET20MS\r\nAnnually, 30% off: LET30MA\r\n\r\nAnyone interested in any non-LET plan, please quote either of the discount codes, and we will apply half the discount to any other VPS order placed for the respective billing period (so any other VPS plan paid quarterly will receive 5% off, semi annually paid VPS will receive 10% off, and annual payments will receive 15% discount).
