We moved into the VPS market in May of 2011 as IPXcore. We started this because we were on a BurstNET node that kept getting oversold, and we were unable to get any form of support. We decided that we could do better.\r\n\r\nAll of our nodes are located in the ColoCrossing Data Center in New York. We're running OpenVZ virtualization on our very own Dell and HP Opteron-powered hardware. All nodes are on 100 megabit.\r\n\r\nA couple VPS hosting companies closed their doors today, we would like to extend this promo to their former customers:\r\nUse promo code REFUGEE for recurring 10% off!\r\n\r\nThe Offers:\r\n\r\n**TinyVPS**\r\n4 CPU cores\r\n128mb RAM \r\n160mb burst RAM (vswap available on request)\r\n5gb Disk Space\r\n200gb bandwidth\r\n\r\n$1.79 per month: https://ipxcore.com/order/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=7\r\n($1.61 per month with promo code)\r\n\r\n**IronVPS**\r\n4 CPU cores\r\n192mb RAM\r\n224mb burst RAM \r\n10gb Disk Space\r\n300gb bandwidth\r\n\r\n$3.49 per month: https://ipxcore.com/order/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5\r\n($3.14 per month with promo code)\r\n\r\n**BronzeVPS**\r\n4 CPU cores\r\n320mb RAM\r\n384mb burst RAM (vswap available on request)\r\n20gb Disk Space\r\n400gb bandwidth\r\n\r\n$5.99 per month: https://ipxcore.com/order/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=6\r\n($5.39 with promo code)\r\n\r\nAdditional IPv4 addresses available for $1.50 per month apiece, with justification.\r\nSpecial:16 IPv4 addresses for $20 per month\r\nWe're working on IPv6.\r\n\r\nNeed ram/disk space/bandwidth?
