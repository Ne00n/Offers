Today is the 25th of December in Netherlands, and although this is not the main point of Christmas, we have decided to copy Santa, except that the gifts are not permanent. For this reason, we are giving away 2 of Online.net's Dedibox WOPR SAS 2014v2 for exactly 7 days (from 25th December to the first of January). If you really need one of these for such period of time, please let me know in the comments and I will be happy to grant one for you for 7 days for free!"}
