Our new plans/locations part of our OpenVZ.io range:\r\n\r\n**NEW RAID50 OpenVZ Storage Plans**&lt;br&gt;\r\n(Amsterdam, London &amp; Dallas TX) (RAID50 - Enterprise SATA/SAS Drives) (1 IPv4/IPv6)&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 vCore -- 150GB HDD -- 256MB RAM -- 500GB Traffic -- [**$23.44/year**](https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=156)&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 vCore -- 512GB HDD -- 512MB RAM -- 2TB Traffic -- [**$4.02/mo**](https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=153)&lt;br&gt;\r\nAdditional plans (1TB &amp; 2TB) available [here](https://openvz.io/). No restrictions on use case of VPS but we do not recommend using this for anything important as is aimed at backups primarily.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**NEW Extreme OpenVZ Plans**&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe EXTREME plans are designed for cheap yet reliable VPS hosting in various locations across the globe. The costs are kept low as there is no support (beyond network &amp; node performance issues) &amp; no SLA (though we usually credit on any downtime). All hardware is owned and mostly use similar hardware to our main line (Dual E5, 128GB+ RAM, Ent HDDs, RAID10)\r\n\r\n**Current Locations: Dallas, Chicago, Miami, Bucharest (RO)**&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocations Coming Soon (Few Weeks Max): Stockholm (Sweden), Frankfurt (Germany), Seattle WA (US)\r\n\r\n**X128** -- 1 vCore, 25GB HDD, 128MB RAM, 500GB Traffic -- [**$10.71/year**](https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=157)&lt;br&gt;\r\n**X256** -- 1 vCore, 50GB HDD, 256MB RAM, 1TB Traffic -- [**$18.75/year**](https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=158)&lt;br&gt;\r\n**X512** -- 2 vCore, 75GB HDD, 512MB RAM, 2TB Traffic -- [**$3.35/month**](https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=159)&lt;br&gt;\r\n**X1024** -- 2 vCore, 100GB HDD, 1024MB RAM, 3TB Traffic -- [**$4.35/month**](https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=160)&lt;br&gt;\r\n**X2048** -- 3 vCore, 125GB HDD, 2048MB RAM, 4TB Traffic -- [**$5.69/month**](https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=161)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nPlease see order form for discount on yearly payments (around 20%). \r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\nFAQ (For Storage &amp; Extreme Plans)\r\n&lt;li&gt;All plans listed above have a special department for sales/billing/support -- io@iniz.com or the \"OpenVZ IO\" department from client area - Response time for these plans is within 24 hours though this will decrease in due to course&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;All plans listed above have 24 hour refund policy, submit ticket within 24 hours should you wish to cancel for a limited time&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;You can upgrade between plans at anytime through the client area&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Whilst we can offer individual resource upgrades, it will be alot cheaper for you to upgrade to next higher plan&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;We have new locations coming soon, you may request to be moved upon a new location opening, otherwise 1 migration request per VM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Extreme EU locations will soon have a small additional fee due to higher IP costs, currently no fee applies&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;All plans listed are solely unmanaged but we try to help when we can if you have the odd request&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;IPv6 can be requested in single addresses only at this time&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;cPanel/DirectAdmin License: https://my.iniz.com/cart.php?gid=26&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Signing up with fake details (even passing fraud checks) will result in termination of your account with no second chances, all orders are reviewed manually within 24 hours although setup is instant upon payment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\nAbout Us:\r\n&lt;li&gt;INIZ is a trading name of SYN LTD&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Pricing correct on 15/07/16 | Pricing Ex.
