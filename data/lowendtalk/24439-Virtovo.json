We're a young company and do not have a long story to tell. We are committed to writing a successful story going forward through good quality hardware and a commitment to customer service.  \r\n\r\nWe currently only offer services out of Coresite, Miami. IPv6 is available in this location but IPv6 is not currently offered with these plans. We are investigating the best way to allocate /64s to customers instead of fragmented addresses which SolusVM allocates by default. We hope to have a solution to this shortly.  \r\n\r\nWe use Blesta for our billing/support and SolusVM for our VPS control.  We've made modifications to our client area to enable near full control of your VPS from within the client area (including mounting ISOs, change boot priority, VNC console access, enabling PAE etc)\r\n\r\n![](http://oi62.tinypic.com/35b87ix.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Node specifications**  \r\n* Dual E5-2620v2 (2.1Ghz)  \r\n* 128GB RAM  \r\n* Minimum 8 Disk LSI Raid 10 Array  \r\n* Redundant 1Gbps uplinks at the node level  \r\n\r\n**Important info**  \r\n[Terms of service ](http://www.virtovo.com/tos.html)  \r\n[Acceptable use policy](http://www.virtovo.com/aup.html)  \r\n[Privacy policy](http://www.virtovo.com/privacy.html)  \r\n[Public Status](http://status.virtovo.com/)  \r\n\r\n**Test IP/Files**  \r\nmia.virtovo.com  \r\n[http://mia.virtovo.com/100MB.zip  ](http://mia.virtovo.com/100MB.zip)  \r\n[http://mia.virtovo.com/1GB.zip  ](http://mia.virtovo.com/1GB.zip)  \r\n\r\n\r\n**KVMH1**  \r\n512MB RAM  \r\n1 Cores   \r\n25GB HDD  \r\n1TB Transfer  \r\n1 IPv4 Address  \r\nSolusVM  \r\n$3.50/mo | [ORDER](https://client.virtovo.com/plugin/order/main/configure/KVMH/?pricing_id=1&amp;group_id=1) | Use coupon: **LEBLETSPRING**  \r\n\r\n**KVMH2**  \r\n1024MB RAM  \r\n2 Cores  \r\n50GB HDD  \r\n2TB Transfer  \r\n1 IPv4 Address  \r\nSolusVM  \r\n$7/mo | [ORDER](https://client.virtovo.com/plugin/order/main/configure/KVMH/?pricing_id=2&amp;group_id=1) | Use coupon: **LEBLETSPRING**  \r\n\r\nRemember, click 'Have a coupon' on the right of the order form and enter **LEBLETSPRING**     \r\n"}
