It is mainly financed by IT consulting we offer in Germany, which is why we can offer you a high-end system for an ultra-low price.\r\n\r\nOur primary goal is **security, redundancy and high-availability**.\r\n\r\n## Review\r\nSome users were given a chance to benchmark our VPS, @nexusrain was one of them and even reviewed his experience; thank you!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/61711/servercow-enterprise-capable-vps\r\n\r\n## Offer\r\n**Order link:** https://cp.servercow.de/order/main/packages/vps/?set_language=en_us\r\n\r\n**Price:** 5\u20ac (which is $5.57 right now)\r\n\r\n**What you get:**\r\n \r\n- High redundancy (**RAID60, 16 SSDs, multiple NICs, multiple PSU**)\r\n\r\n- automated full-backups every 2nd day\r\n\r\n- **512MB RAM,  1 vCore, 10GB SSD**\r\n\r\n- 150GB via Samba and FTP on a RAID5 storage server (**mountable**)\r\n\r\n- a **fair-use** traffic flat (we care about our network!)\r\n\r\n- 1 IPv4 (5 IPv6)\r\n\r\n- Highly monitored systems\r\n\r\n- 1 Gbit/s (current carriers DTAG, Hibernia, GTT, DECIX - test here: http://lg.datafabrik.de )\r\n\r\n**What happens at DDoS attacks:** When you are under attack, our hardware will automatically disable your IP until the attack stops. \r\nPlease keep in mind that a DDoS protected webspace is not really hard to archive nowadays. DDoS protect a KVM machine in contrast is very expensive (done right).\r\n\r\n(Our primary website is not yet fully translated: www.servercow.de )\r\n\r\nPS: Do you know our mailcow? -&gt; www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/58855/mailcow-a-complete-mail-server-suite"}
