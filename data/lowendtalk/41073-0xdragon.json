The occupants are restless, looking at their watches.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; _Enter, stage right, John bumps against the door, attempting to open it by pulling instead of pushing._\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **John**: \"Sorry I'm late guys. Shall I get started?\"\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; _John places his messenger bag on the table and looks up at the board. He is greeted by faces of stony disapproval, and hurries to unpack his presentation._\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **John**: \"*Uhhmm* Is the new year not shaping up to all you hoped it to be? Did our family get you socks again, or an itchy woolen jumper? Or did you have an amazing Christmas and a really happy new year?\"\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; _Pause. Accentuated awkward silence, background noise of ringing phones and secretaries rushing past the room._\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **John**: \"Either way, I want to show you something that will **really** light up your new year.\"\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; _He looks at the board again, grinning bravely, hoping for some enthusiasm. There was none._\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **John**: \"Announcing, CloudCommando!\"\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Steven, a junior executive, stands up to interrupt.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **Steven**: \"John... You do realize we launched CloudCommando thirty days ago?\"\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; **John**: \"-Yeeahhhh, but now we have website monitoring!\"\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **Steven**: \"Not good enough John. You're wasting company time and money. Your project died ages ago.\"\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; _Steven crosses to the door, about to open it and leave. The other execs start grabbing their bags and packing too._\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **John**: \"Wait! Wait! One last thing! We're going to give out free stuff.\"\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; _Steven's hand falls from the door handle for a moment, his voice sightly apprehensive._\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; **Steven**: \"What sort of free stuff, John?\"\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **John**: \"Lights! USB lights! We'll call it 'CloudCommando, Lighting Up Your New Year!'\"\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; _All the execs in the room start thinking of the possibilities and begin excitedly discussing amongst themselves. Steven turns and smiles greatly. _\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;  **Steven**: \"You're back on the team, John.\"\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; END.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, that's how I got myself back onto the team of CloudCommando.\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;We will be giving out 1 USB light for every 10 orders! :D&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a name=\"offer\"/&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Special Observium Plan!&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n   * **$5 / year**\r\n   * Hosted Observium with tweaks!\r\n   * SSL Access\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cloudcommando.com/special_plan/\"&gt;Grab yours here, limited stock!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Special GitLab Plan!&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n   * **&lt;del&gt;$24&lt;/del&gt;** **$15 / year**\r\n   * Hosted GitLab!\r\n   * Small Plan Rules Apply!\r\n   * Dedicated IPv4 Address\r\n   * SSL Access and Wildcard SSL certificate for your domain on request!\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cloudcommando.com/special_plan/\"&gt;Grab yours here, limited stock!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Special Piwik Plan!&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n   * **&lt;del&gt;$12&lt;/del&gt; $10/ year**\r\n   * Hosted Piwik\r\n   * Small Plan Rules Apply!\r\n   * SSL Access\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cloudcommando.com/special_plan/\"&gt;Grab yours here, limited stock!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Small Plan Rules Apply!\r\n\r\n&gt; Some of our general tips for using the small plan:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - Be fair!\r\n&gt; - We love you, never be afraid to ask if you need help! &lt;3\r\n&gt; - These are general guidelines, not strict rules.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Again, open a ticket if you need a hand, and play nice!\r\n\r\nNeed more convincing about our hosted Observium?
