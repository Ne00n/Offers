We also operate our own fully redundant, multi-datacenter Juniper based network.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more about our technical infrastructure and how we take care of their operation? - See our [infrastructure details](https://www.fastpipe.io/infrastructure).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Some key features of our Cloud Servers**\r\n\r\n* **Excellent connectivity:** By default, every cloud server node is connected with 2x 10Gbit to our network. This provides network-level fault resilience, fast data transfers, and best performance even at peak times. Network-intensive applications are excellently hosted with us.\r\n\r\n* **DDoS-Protection:**  Our cloud servers include our exclusive DDoS protection, which unique beside other well known solutions. Even DDoS attacks on web applications are filtered out by our DDoS protection.\r\n\r\n* **Additional IP-Addresses:** You can add additional IP addresses (from 1.49\u20ac) and subnets (from 6.95\u20ac) to your instance. The setup takes place immediately, the reserved address ranges are routed to an instance of your choice.\r\n\r\n* **Daily Backup:** Data loss is annoying. Accordingly, our cloud server nodes are equipped with several hard drives (hardware raid) as standard. You can avoid the risk of self-generated data loss with minimal effort through our automated snapshot backups. For this purpose we make a complete backup of your server daily between 02:00 to 10:00 am.\r\n\r\n* **Scale at any time:** Do you need more CPU power, memory or disk space instant? Scale your server automatically to the next higher level, fully automated and without changing the existing configuration or data. We only charge you the difference in connection with the current remaining term.\r\n\r\n* **Virtual Private Lan:** Create your own, isolated networks with our Virtual Private Lan (VPL). VPLs behave like V-Lans and provide an internal network between different instances where you can freely use your own IP addresses. Choose between 1Gbit, 2Gbit or 5Gbit interfaces.\r\n\r\n* **Free BGP (BETA) - Limited time deal:** Already own an AS and IP-Space? For new customers, we provide a limited time deal.
