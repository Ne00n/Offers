I am only posting because I thought this was a great deal (for me). So if I am unknowingly breaking any LET rules, please excuse. It doesnt benefit me at all.\r\n\r\n[Link](http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/st34) http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/st34 \r\nHetzner: i7-3770 32 GB RAM 2x3TB 200Mbps for \u20ac34 (incl VAT)\r\nExtra IPs are \u20ac1 each. \r\n\r\nI dont know public opinion about Hetzner (old hardware, etc), for me it is acceptable. I ordered 1 server yesterday and 1 more today. I actually need the disk space.. and I realize it might be overkill for most.. but its great for me. \r\n\r\nSince VAT doesnt apply to me, my invoice automatically excludes VAT.. so for US$36 (no setup fee), this is excellent deal. (Only thing better would have been having same offer in US)\r\n\r\nIn my scenario, I prefer Raid-0 in CentOS 6.5. Sharing my steps for the rare person who needs the same:\r\n\r\nSTEP 1: Boot to rescue, delete old partitions and move to MBR to GPT\r\n\r\n    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1\r\n    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1\r\n    sgdisk -R /dev/sdb /dev/sda\r\n\r\nSTEP 2: Boot to VNC, and perform a GUI based CentOS installation. Now CentOS can be used with Raid-0"}
