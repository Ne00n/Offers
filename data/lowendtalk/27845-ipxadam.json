Our East Coast location previously existed in ColoCrossing Buffalo, now we are much closer to New York City in a DuPont Fabros data center. This move allowed us to increase our power consumption and bandwidth throughput. The more notable benefits of the move are native IPv6 support and improved control over automated null-routing of DDoS attacks. Also now all virtual servers now have gigabit connectivity.\r\n\r\nAt this time our East Coast servers are fully functional. We have put the Budget Servers back in stock:\r\n[$1/month](https://ipxcore.com/budget-vps/)\r\n96MB RAM\r\n32MB vSwap\r\n6GB Disk\r\n200GB Bandwidth.\r\n\r\nIf you need something more powerful we have put together a 40% recurring discount code that works on any [premium VPS](https://ipxcore.com/premium-vps/).
