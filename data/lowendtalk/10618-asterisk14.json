Must have minimum 64MB RAM although 96 would be better, 2GB HDD, not bothered about bandwidth. Got this from VirtualVM. \r\n\r\nOr I'll sell it for $6 dollars (4 GBP). This would ideal for someone from the USA or Asia. I need a server in UK/Europe/East Coast USA to reduce ping times/latency.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested let me know."}
