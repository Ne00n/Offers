We have recently migrated our entire infrastructure to our completely owned hardware in the Dallas Tierpoint via ColoCrossing facility.\r\n\r\nALL servers were upgraded to brand new CPU E3-1240 v3 servers, this was a huge upgrade for all of our existing clients who received these upgrades for FREE. We also introduced SSD-Caching technology on all of our servers, this was another FREE upgrade that we offered all of our existing and new clients!\r\n\r\nALL of our virtual servers, including the ones listed below come with free SSD caching as an added bonus. Come be a part of our family today and take advantage of the new features that we will be rolling out as well as the free upgrades that come with choosing us as your provider!\r\n\r\nFor LowEndBox, we have 3 OVZ specials.\r\n\r\nAll servers feature RAID 10, SSD Caching, 1Gbps uplinks, and much more!\r\n\r\nWorried about going with those deadpoolers?
