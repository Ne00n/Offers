It's of no use to me as it was dependant on me staying there.\r\n\r\nIt's an **i3-2100, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD** Dell server, practically brand new. It's \u00a3400 new and is literally brand new and has only been co-lo'd for a week or so and that's when the box was opened.\r\n\r\nIf anybody is interested, can you PM me your offers or to request more details. The colocation is in a 12 month contract so that would have to be transferred over to the buyer. It's in a Tier 3 DC with the cheapest co-lo prices I've seen. The network it's on is fantastic.\r\n\r\nI've got a few interested, but nothing is confirmed.\r\n\r\nThank you."}
