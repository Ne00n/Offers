I occasionally dabble in C but only socially and I'm responsible about it (you won't catch me not checking bounds).\r\n\r\nMust be easy going, have a good CPU and be willing to share me with others (I have an older sibling much more dedicated to one-on-ones but that's just not my thing, sorry).\r\n\r\nI live on the shores of Sea Peue (I'm not an OpenITC Vale snob) and it's not as bad as everyone makes out btw. I like going out for SMTP and the occasional backup DB but don't even ask me about open proxies - that's too dirty or me!\r\n\r\nAll pictures are recent and no I've not had any work done on my motherboard - it's all natural :)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, hit me up, I don't byte (haha - aren't I fun?!)\r\n\r\nThis user does not wish to be contacted about commercial services.\r\n\r\n\r\n**KVM**\r\n\r\nKVM VPS Option #1: \u00a32.50/month (~$4.17USD)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2 vCPU Cores&lt;br /&gt;\r\n512MB RAM&lt;br /&gt;\r\n25GB Disk&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2.5TB Monthly transfer&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2 x /64 IPv6 subnets&lt;br /&gt;\r\nGigabit connection&lt;br /&gt;\r\n12.5GB FREE FTP BACKUP SPACE Order URL&lt;br /&gt;\r\nhttps://clients.openitc.co.uk/order/type/20&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nKVM VPS Option #2: \u00a34.00/month (~$6.67USD)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n4 vCPU Cores&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1GB RAM&lt;br /&gt;\r\n50GB Disk&lt;br /&gt;\r\n5TB Monthly transfer&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2 x /64 IPv6 subnets&lt;br /&gt;\r\nGigabit connection&lt;br /&gt;\r\n25GB FREE FTP BACKUP SPACE Order URL&lt;br /&gt;\r\nhttps://clients.openitc.co.uk/order/type/20&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n**OS's Available**\r\n\r\nYou can self-install any OS that's on a Chunk Encoding enabled HTTP server which is accessible from our servers.

If you don't have the expertise to manage a VPS yourself, please check out [OpenITC](http://www.openitc.co.uk) instead."}
