So 3 codes in total.\r\n\r\nI'm selling these 3 keys for either 10$ for them all or small vps/instance :&gt;\r\n\r\nI should say that in case someone wants to trade it for a vps, here's what I'm looking for:\r\n128-512mb ram\r\n5gb disk (ssd preferred)\r\n150gb bandie\r\n\r\nI'd personally prefer it if when offering a plan with a lower amount of ram, to offer an extended period of usage if possible (I rather have a 128mb instance running for a year)"}
