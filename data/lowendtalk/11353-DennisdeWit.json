But they are listed at SpamHaus, which means most of my email's wont be received by my clients, as my mails get blocked by SH.\r\n\r\nSo, I am seeking for a new VPS. I have some requirements, and I hope I can find one who meets them.\r\n\r\nI need\r\n\r\n- 2 GB RAM or more;\r\n- 1 TB Bandwith or more;\r\n- Flash Media Services, IRC Server/Flashpolicyd, Shoutcast server allowed;\r\n- In Europe (I live in The Netherlands). The Netherlands EXCLUDED.\r\n- Somewhere between $1 and $15 USD.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDennis "}
