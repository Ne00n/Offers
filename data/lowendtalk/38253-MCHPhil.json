We aim to offer your the most features at the lowest price possible. With multiple offsite backup locations, CloudFlare, Softaculous and Nginx+Varnish, and KVM VPS, we feel we are almost there but if you have any suggestions to a feature we should add to our lineup please let us know!\r\n\r\n&lt;u&gt;**Standard Features**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n- SolusVM Powered&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Native IPv6&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Powerful Intel E5 CPU's&lt;br&gt;\r\n- SSD-Caching&lt;br&gt;\r\n- NO BS!&lt;br&gt;\r\n- DDoS Protection (Provided for free via OVH PRO DDoS protection, ticket to have this enabled full time or on demand (default).)\r\n\r\n&lt;u&gt;**Recent Changes**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Added CentOS 7 template!&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Created a script to set up networking when installing from an ISO. Can be found in KB!&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Added CentOS 7 ISO.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Added CentOS 5 x86 / x86_64 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x86 / x86_64 templates.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- All new VM's will come with an internal IP address!  Existing clients please ticket for an internal IP address.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Weekly backups are being reconsidered at this time due to the issues experienced with the last node failure in NC.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Nightly backups have been changed to weekly due to more than half of the nodes taking longer than 24 hours to complete the backup process.&lt;br&gt;\r\n- With the help of a few members here I have made changes to all of the KVM templates provided.  They will now auto-configure the network connection of your Canadian KVM VPS.  Provision and go!  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n**KVM Canada Offers**\r\n\r\n**Happy Thanksgiving and Happy Black Friday!**\r\n\r\nIn celebration of Thanksgiving and Black Friday this year I wanted to give some free resources away!  These will be very easy to obtain.  On the order form select the add-on you would like.  Understand you may only choose one add-on.  Selecting multiple will delay deployment of your additional resources.\r\n\r\n**You may choose 1 of the following**:&lt;br&gt;\r\n- 50% More Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n- 50% More Transfer&lt;br&gt;\r\n- 1 Extra IPv4 Address\r\n\r\nAdd-ons are provisioned manually, VPS will provision after payment confirmation, as always.\r\n\r\nPlan Name: &lt;u&gt;**LET-BF-1GB-10GB-1TB-MONTHLY**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualization Platform: KVM&lt;br&gt;\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 1 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSwap: 1 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSSD Cached Disk Space: 10 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Premium Transfer: 1024 GB**&lt;br&gt;\r\nIP Space: 1 IPv4 + 5 IPv6&lt;br&gt;\r\nCPU Cores: 1&lt;br&gt;\r\nMonthly Cost: $4&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder Link: https://billing.mycustomhosting.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=151\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n\r\nPlan Name: &lt;u&gt;**LET-BF-2GB-20GB-2TB-MONTHLY**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualization Platform: KVM&lt;br&gt;\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 2 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSwap: 2 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSSD Cached Disk Space: 20 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Premium Transfer: 2048 GB**&lt;br&gt;\r\nIP Space: 1 IPv4 + 5 IPv6&lt;br&gt;\r\nCPU Cores: 2&lt;br&gt;\r\nMonthly Cost: $5&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder Link: https://billing.mycustomhosting.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=152\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n\r\nPlan Name: &lt;u&gt;**LET-BF-3GB-30GB-3TB-MONTHLY**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualization Platform: KVM&lt;br&gt;\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 3 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSwap: 3 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSSD Cached Disk Space: 30 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Premium Transfer: 3072 GB**&lt;br&gt;\r\nIP Space: 1 IPv4 + 5 IPv6&lt;br&gt;\r\nCPU Cores: 3&lt;br&gt;\r\nMonthly Cost: $6&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder Link: https://billing.mycustomhosting.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=153\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n\r\nPlan Name: &lt;u&gt;**LET-BF-4GB-40GB-4TB-QUARTERLY**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualization Platform: KVM&lt;br&gt;\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 4 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSwap: 4 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSSD Cached Disk Space: 40 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Premium Transfer: 4096 GB**&lt;br&gt;\r\nIP Space: 1 IPv4 + 5 IPv6&lt;br&gt;\r\nCPU Cores: 4&lt;br&gt;\r\nQuarterly Cost: $21&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder Link: https://billing.mycustomhosting.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=154\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n\r\nPlan Name: &lt;u&gt;**LET-BF-512MB-10GB-4TB-YEARLY**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualization Platform: KVM&lt;br&gt;\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 512 MB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSwap: 512 MB&lt;br&gt;\r\nSSD Cached Disk Space: 10 GB&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Premium Transfer: 4096 GB**&lt;br&gt;\r\nIP Space: 1 IPv4 + 5 IPv6&lt;br&gt;\r\nCPU Cores: 2&lt;br&gt;\r\nYearly Cost: $18&lt;br&gt;\r\nOrder Link: https://billing.mycustomhosting.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=155\r\n\r\n&lt;u&gt;**Reviews**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Review #1](http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/34747/mycustomhosting-6-month-review)&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Review #2](http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/16291/my-custom-hosting-reviews-anyone/p1)&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Review #3](http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/512547/#Comment_512547) - &lt;i&gt;\"In my opinion, when it comes to real world performance of SSD-cached KVM nobody beats MCHPhil\r\nMy large databases finish report runs 3x to 5x faster then other similarly spec'ed low end providers, and only some pure SSD run them faster. \r\nNote: I have been a very happy client of MyCustomHosting since August (2013) and highly recommend you try them.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Review #4](http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/498884/#Comment_498884) - &lt;i&gt;\"I agree, very dependable - best uptime of any of my boxes.
