One could look for the underlying virtualization and hope for FreeBSD support if it's KVM or XEN-HVM, but in many cases this doesn't work, e.g. because the vendor doesn't commit for non-Linux support.\r\n\r\nCan you list here your recent experience with VPS providers offering FreeBSD containers?\r\n\r\nHere's what I saw:\r\n\r\n* [hetzner.de](http://www.hetzner.de) - good performance, uptime, support\r\n* [nqhost.com](http://www.nqhost.com) - excellent performance, uptime, support\r\n* [chicagovps.net](http://www.chicagovps.net)\r\n* [edis.at](http://www.edis.at)\r\n* photonvps.com - messy support, stay away\r\n* arpnetworks.com - unreliable and messy support, stay away"}
