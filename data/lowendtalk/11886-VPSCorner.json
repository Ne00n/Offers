Our packages start from $4.99 on our website http://vpscorner.co.uk and the code is LET-10OFF.\r\n\r\nVPSCorner is UK Based and has nodes in Moldova. The only issue we've ever had since we started was when three nodes were down for 24hrs due to a kernel issue, we issued all customers affected a full months credit in compensation for the 24hrs down time (our only ever down time) and we had zero data loss. We paid a significant sum for this issue to be resolved without issue to techs who billed per 30minutes.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that we offer a large variety of images for our customers to choose from including VNC/GUI images as well as a pre-secured VPSCorner image. We can also assist with installing some scripts but please check first, it depends on how long it will take etc.\r\n\r\nOn to the offer. Our offer will give you 10% off all packages.
