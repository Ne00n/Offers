At this point, I am not looking to charge, but consider it a time limited beta test. It will not be a couple of weeks, I'm looking to test for about 2 months. I am reaching out to grab about 5 people for testing out service that I am looking to provide publicly. \r\n\r\nAll VPS will be 1GB RAM, 50GB Disk, 250GB Transfer. I will install any template that you can provide a download url for. \r\n\r\nAll hosting will be provided by myself on behalf of my company. We utilize a fully redundant network and power infrastructure on hardware we own. Our carriers include Level3, CenturyLink, Verizon, Yipes, XO, Zayo, twtelecom and Comcast. We have a long term lease on datacenter space in Viawest, and are looking to begin filling the racks. We have been hosting since 2007, but always white-label. I'd like to establish a name for the company I have started.\r\n\r\nLet me know via PM if you are interested, I am not going to deal with problematic testers at this time, abuse and other shenanigans will be terminated immediately. \r\n\r\nComments are welcome, I encourage any questions!"}
