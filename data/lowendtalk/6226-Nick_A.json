Our years of hosting experience as both clients and providers have inspired us to offer the kind of hosting that clients want at the kind of prices clients want to pay. Though our prices are low, performance is our main focus. We know that our best assets are our loyal customers, so we strive to provide hosting they will rave about to their fellow internet users. Our **SSD and SSD-cached VPSs** are perfect for a wide range of applications. With our top quality hardware, we can guarantee that our clients will get the most bang for their buck.\r\n\r\nOur SuperMicro enterprise grade servers are stocked with **Samsung 830 SSDs** in lightning fast, **LSI-powered RAID10** arrays. Our servers provide incredible I/O as well as the safety of drive redundancy. We use powerful Intel **Ivy Bridge E3v2** Quad Core processors on our VPS nodes. These CPUs run at a minimum of 3.3GHz per core. CPU is allocated on a fair share basis per VPS, only limited by the number of cores in each plan.\r\n\r\nOur VPSs are hosted in **Atlanta**, GA. Our servers are located at 55 Marietta, where we own all of our hardware and network (AS3842).\r\n\r\nRamNode offers **KVM** and **OpenVZ** VPSs.

KVM VPSs are available instantly, but you are responsible for installing the OS ([KVM Guide](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=44 \"KVM Guide\")).\r\n\r\n**How can I pay?**\r\nWe accept PayPal and Google Wallet.\r\n\r\n**How long have you been in business?**\r\nRamNode LLC was founded in June 2012. We have hosted hundreds of clients in other professional capacities since 2006.\r\n\r\n**What's the best way to get help when I need it?**\r\nOur VPSs are unmanaged, but you can open a ticket for acceptable support requests. We are also available on Live Chat, Skype, and IRC. \r\n\r\n**What kind of hardware do you use?**\r\nWe use Intel Ivy Bridge E3v2 CPUs, LSI RAID cards, Samsung 830 SSDs, and Western Digital or Seagate enterprise HDDs.\r\n\r\n**How fast is your connection?**\r\nOur VPS nodes are connected to the internet at 1Gbps. Your VPS can use all of that speed on a fair share basis.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any network tests?**\r\nAtlanta:\r\nIPv4 - 199.241.28.6\r\nIPv6 - 2604:180::2\r\nIPv4 100MB download - test.atl.ramnode.com/100MB.test\r\nIPv6 100MB download - http://[2604:180::7a1c:3cd1]/100MB.test\r\n\r\n**Do you have any benchmarks?**\r\n\r\n* http://reviews.myhken.com/benchmark-ramnode-com-1024mb-plan/ **(Atlanta SVZ Hardware)**\r\n* http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2012/08/27/VNczwUt8Y4bUzfag **(Atlanta SVZ Hardware)**\r\n* http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2012/08/29/o2yxg8uhCWY2HHMT **(Atlanta CVZ Hardware)**\r\n* http://vpseer.com/hosting-plan/62/ramnode-com-1024mb-cvz-1gb-ram-50gb-15-usd **(Atlanta CVZ Hardware)**\r\n* http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2012/10/25/habw3rpf1taDXlHO **(Atlanta SKVM Hardware)**\r\n* http://reviews.myhken.com/benchmark-ramnode-com-atlanta-kvm-1-gb/ **(Atlanta SKVM Hardware)**\r\n* http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2012/09/27/4pTauwwtJCGJWCpm **(Atlanta CKVM Hardware)**\r\n* http://vpslist.net/cheapvps/2012/09/ramnode-review-ssd-vps-showdown/ **(Compares SVZ, CVZ, and SKVM options)**\r\n\r\n**What's the difference between SSD and SSD-Cached?**\r\nSSD-cached VPSs store \"hot\" data (data frequently called on by the server) in a RAID10 array of SSDs. These VPSs come with lots of hard drive space, but still have similar performance to an all-SSD VPS.\r\n\r\n**What operating systems are available?**\r\nWe offer a [variety](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=48 \"variety\") of Linux 32 and 64-bit OS templates and ISOs.\r\n\r\n**Can I use my VPS for ___?**\r\nPlease see our [AUP](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/aup.php \"AUP\").\r\n\r\n**What control panel comes with your VPSs?**\r\nOur VPSs come with the SolusVM control panel.\r\n\r\n**Do you provide remote backups?**\r\nYes, we take remote backups of each VPS image on a weekly basis.
