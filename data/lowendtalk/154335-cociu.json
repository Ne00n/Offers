Many of you know hostsolutions.ro from the beginning and is know we have been very responsive with the customer support but this was lost in the latest year so i need to take this very serious and change this because is consume all our time. Is true we have grow much and we are still grow, maybe this is the principal cause for what i need to change this module , nothing to complain until xxxxx amount of customers , after this all was a nightmare with modulesfactory. So if i recommend it ? yes but definitely not for large production !\r\n\r\nAll this explained in the next month i will like to test some solutions for LXC and KVM and i will start with modulesgarden to see how is work , so we offer for free the first 90 vps durring 1 month . After this period your vps will be terminated without any notification. Durring this perriod we can reboot the node many time , limit traffic , change the panel interface from your client area , enable/disable some features, etc etc etc etc  so you need to be ok with this.\r\n\r\nNO DUPLICATED ORDERS PLEASE , WE WILL TERMINATE ALL VPS INVOLUCRATED IN THIS\r\nNO SPAM , MINING, ETC ETC. THIS IS A TEST SERVER SO WE NEED A ACCURATE RESOLUTION\r\n\r\nSo here we are , today we put 90 free vps in the table with this config :\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;LXC\r\n&lt;br /&gt;1 core\r\n&lt;br /&gt;1 gb ram\r\n&lt;br /&gt;50 gb hdd\r\n&lt;br /&gt;1 ipv4\r\n&lt;br /&gt;1gbps port speed /10tb traffic included\r\n\r\nlink to place the order : https://secure.hostsolutions.ro/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=346\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be verry happy to recive any kind of feedback .\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope have some feedback here in this thread about the panel , features, etc etc. how you like the module interface , usage , etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReally thanks for all your help !\r\n\r\n\r\n@Nekki more space for your porn !\r\n\r\n\r\nNext round will be kvm .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
