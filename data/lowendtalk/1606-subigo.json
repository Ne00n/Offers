But on the flip side, we are definitely not a fly-by-night host. I've been offering VPS plans for years now and even had a LET offer posted back in 2009: http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/zensix-6-99-128mb-openvz-vps\r\n\r\nIt's limited stock, as I just need to fill up a few older public nodes. There are three plans, but I'll just post the lowest priced one here:\r\n\r\n**Budget-VZ1**\r\nGuaranteed RAM - 128 MB\r\nBurst RAM - 192 MB\r\nDisk Space\t - 10 GB\r\nBandwidth\t- 200 GB\r\nIP Addresses - One\r\nCPU Cores - One\r\n100Mbit Shared Port\r\nPrice: $29.95/year\r\n\r\nMore details: http://zensix.com\r\n\r\nYou should also be aware that these specific plans will be on nodes without hardware RAID and do not include TUN/TAP or ipv6. If there is a real interest in these low priced plans, I'll get some more nodes set up and not be so restrictive.\r\n\r\nServers are in Kansas City at both Wholesale Internet and Datashack (hence the no hardware RAID). Most likely you will all go on NODE6, which is at Datashack. Uptime reports and server statuses can be found here: http://status.zensix.com\r\n\r\nSetup is done manually and can take up to 24 hours."}
