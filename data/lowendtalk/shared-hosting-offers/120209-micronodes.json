We have spent many years buying hosting ourselves and know what kind of a host a customer wants. We sell unmanaged Premium Dedicated Server VPS\u2019s, but we provide as much support as we can. Upon request, we can assist our customers in setting up gameservers on their VPS\u2019s. Our VPS\u2019s support a wide range of Operating Systems such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, &amp; even Windows Server (Unlicensed - Bring Your Own License). Our goal is to provide fast, secure, and high quality VPS's at an affordable rate. We utilize SpartanHost through Wowrack's Datacenter to host our nodes in Seattle, Washington. We have been in the business for many months now and have grown to now provide premium dedicated servers and shared web hosting. We are your affordable and sustainable hosting solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur company has recently expanded into shared web hosting to provide an affordable easy solution for those who don't necessarily need a large robust VPS, but want a solution that will easily get their website done.
