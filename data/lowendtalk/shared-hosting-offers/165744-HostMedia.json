With our range of powerful server resources, we wanted to provide heavy media and application-based hosting that will not fail under the stress that is created by media-based websites and applications. We continue to use our rule on overselling. We do not do it and will sell what we have, so you know that when you order your hosting plan that the hosting space is dedicated to you, not anyone else.\r\n\r\nHost Media Ltd | Company Registration No. 10990171\r\nVAT No. GB283897147 | UK EORI No. GB283897147000\r\n\r\n**Questions?**\r\nWe are always here to help with any questions you may have, feel free to open a sales ticket via our helpdesk."}
