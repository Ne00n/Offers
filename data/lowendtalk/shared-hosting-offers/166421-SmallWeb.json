There are only 12 days left.\r\n\r\nHere's an email we recently sent out to community members who opted in.\r\n&gt;Hi there!\r\n&gt;We're pushing hard to reach our goal of 500 customers and want to give as much back as possible to those who sign up during our early days.\r\n&gt;That's why we're offering a double credit bonus when you deposit up to \u00a35 in your SmallWeb account before 31st August 2020.\r\n&gt;Once you've deposited, simply open a support ticket requesting the double credit bonus to be applied*\r\n&gt;*You may receive a bonus on a maximum of \u00a35.\r\n&gt;To make a deposit please select \"Make Payment\" within the invoices subsection of our client portal.\r\n\r\n&gt;We like to be transparent here and understand that bonus credit promotions can be seen as a negative thing to do. So far we've delivered 17 credit bonuses since incorporation with a value of \u00a3160.56. This is an average of \u00a39.44 per bonus applied. This time over, we are further limiting the maximum deposit to ensure everything's kept in order so you can benefit from a hassle free offer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe have a global reach with 8 available locations.\r\n\r\nAmsterdam | Germany | Los Angeles | Luxembourg | London | Melbourne | New York | Singapore \r\n\r\n[You can view our hosting server specifications here.](https://portal.smallweb.net/blog/hosting-server-specifications \"You can view our hosting server specifications here.\")\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Some of our features:**\r\nNVMe or SSD Storage\r\nRemote Daily Backups\r\nDNS Zone Management \r\nFree Softaculous Installer\r\nFree Let\u2019s Encrypt SSL \r\nFree Website Migration\r\nUnlimited SQL Databases\r\nUnlimited Email Accounts\r\nUnlimited FTP Accounts\r\nCloudLinux CageFS/LVE\r\nMulti PHP Version Selector\r\n99.9% Uptime Guarantee\r\n30 Day Refund Policy\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Shared \u00bdGB - \u00a33.99/year**\r\n\u00bdGB NVMe/SSD - 100GB Monthly Bandwidth - 1 Websites - 1CPU, 20EP &amp; 5MB/s I/O\r\n\r\n[Order now and choose from 8 locations!](https://portal.smallweb.net/order/config/index/shared/?group_id=42&amp;pricing_id=1332 \"Order now and choose from 8 locations!\")\r\n\r\n**Shared 1GB - \u00a36.99/year**\r\n1GB NVMe/SSD - 250GB Monthly Bandwidth - 10 Websites - 1CPU, 25EP &amp; 10MB/s I/O\r\n\r\n[Order now and choose from 8 locations!](https://portal.smallweb.net/order/config/index/shared/?group_id=42&amp;pricing_id=1333 \"Order now and choose from 8 locations!\")\r\n\r\n**Shared 2GB - \u00a39.99/year**\r\n2GB NVMe/SSD - 500GB Monthly Bandwidth - 20 Websites - 1CPU, 30EP &amp; 15MB/s I/O\r\n\r\n[Order now and choose from 8 locations!](https://portal.smallweb.net/order/config/index/shared/?group_id=42&amp;pricing_id=1334 \"Order now and choose from 8 locations!\")\r\n\r\n**Shared 5GB - \u00a319.99/year**\r\n5GB NVMe/SSD - 999GB Monthly Bandwidth - 50 Websites - 1CPU, 30EP &amp; 20MB/s I/O\r\n\r\n[Order now and choose from 8 locations!](https://portal.smallweb.net/order/config/index/shared/?group_id=42&amp;pricing_id=1335 \"Order now and choose from 8 locations!\")\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nServices are manually provisioned.\r\nSmallWeb Ltd.
