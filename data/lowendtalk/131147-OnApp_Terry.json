We use Nginx to deliver your content, supporting http/2. You're able to use our own free shared SSL certificate (i.e. you.r.worldssl.net) or you can bring your own SSL certificate to use at no cost. Our clients experience incredible cache hit rates [(example from CDN.net](http://i.cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-27-at-11.25.25-AM.png)), and our 24/7 support team is there to help you implement CDN.net and fully utilize its capabilities.

CDN.net has support representatives in London, Kuala Lumpar, and Salt Lake City. We &lt;a href=\"http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/onapp-launches-customizable-content-delivery-network-cdn-net\"&gt;launched in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and have been actively helping clients with the web performance problems every day since.\r\n\r\n**Can you tell me about your network?**  \r\nWe source our infrastructure through the OnApp federation, a marketplace of worldwide providers. Through this we're able to purchase bandwidth on a worldwide level, at discount rates. Many premium providers that are LowEndTalk 'favorites', like Clouvider, Total Server Solutions, Innoscale, &amp; SoftLayer contribute to the OnApp federation marketplace. You're able to see our full network of locations we subscribe to here -&gt; https://cdn.net/network/\r\n\r\n**Do you have PoPs in China?**  \r\nYes, we do! In fact, we can now help you source your ICP license to ensure your site is visible in China. Contact me at t@cdn.net for more info.\r\n\r\n**Do you do PAYG CDN?**  \r\nUnfortunately no. We need to sell at a certain price to ensure the cost of support is covered. Likewise, a CDN is most effective when a site has steady traffic. If your site only has a small amount of traffic, I actually suggest focusing on optimizing the code, and images before implementing a CDN.\r\n\r\nAny questions? Looking for a specific PoP?
