We exclusively use KVM on all plans for the greater control that it gives users. We believe in free software and are currently in the progress of writing a &lt;a href=\"https://pbobp.lunanode.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;billing panel&lt;/a&gt; to replace our WHMCS installation. At the moment we're offering various plans in Chicago with 512 MB to 8192 MB memory. We take payments through PayPal (either through PayPal account or credit card) and **&lt;a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;**.\r\n\r\nBudget and Plus KVM plans come with RAID10 HDD storage; they can be upgraded from a single IPv4 address to 5 IPv4 addresses for $3.00/mo or 13 IPv4 addresses for $7.50/mo (note that justification is required for this upgrade). SSD KVM plans come with a single IPv4 address and SSD storage, along with free weekly backups.\r\n\r\nOn Budget/Plus/Special VPS, we offer a custom VM control panel that features the typical management options (although we're currently still using SolusVM for our SSD KVM plans). We recently (yesterday) added VNC access via this control panel, which is integrated into the billing panel. Servers are provisioned out of SingleHop's Chicago datacenter. For all plans, if you don't find your desired operating system on the list then open a ticket before purchase with an ISO you want to install and we'll confirm whether we can add a template (note that we are only able to support Windows on SSD KVM plans).\r\n\r\nAll plans come with a **free single-domain/wildcard AlphaSSL certificate** (additional certificates are $2/yr). cPanel VM licenses are available at $10/mo.\r\n\r\nCustom ISO's are available on all plans if you open a ticket. Windows is also available if you have your own license.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.lunanode.com/budget.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Order budget VPS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://www.lunanode.com/ssdkvm.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;SSD KVM now!&lt;/a&gt; Or &lt;a href=\"https://www.lunanode.com/submitticket.php?step=2&amp;deptid=2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; for questions.
