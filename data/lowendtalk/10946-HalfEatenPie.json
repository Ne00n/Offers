We\u2019ve got a fantastic line started up and we\u2019re planning on continuing our quality of support and services you\u2019ve loved!\r\n \r\nFor those of you guys who don\u2019t know us, Catalyst Host was started by Ryan Arp (@ryanarp ) and the Jarland Donnell (@jarland ) focused on providing our brand of hosting.  We just want you all to know that we\u2019re more than just another provider, we are customers too.  We know what customers want, and we focus on exactly that!

Network and hardware conditions are monitored 24/7/365. Spare hardware is always stocked and available on site. We utilize A+B power for redundancy in case of brownouts, which are rare in Dallas.\r\n \r\n&lt;h2&gt;What Makes Catalyst Host a Special Company?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n \r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do something right, don\u2019t bother doing it.\u201d\r\n \r\nWe seriously made this company for ourselves.  We wanted a service to our quality, and when we realized that what we were doing actually worked we decided that we shouldn\u2019t keep it for ourselves.   We don\u2019t settle for mediocre, we care about our clients, and in reality this isn\u2019t about the money.    \r\n \r\nWe are not here to give you the most imaginary resources you can't use for the least dollar signs. We are here to give you the best quality, with what I estimate to be some of the least oversold nodes in our market. You have the peace of mind that you services are in good hands, that your service will operate as expected, and that your data will remain safe.\r\n \r\n&lt;h2&gt;Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nOur service really does speak for itself.  But here\u2019s some reviews (the first one's about our new KVM system)!\r\n\r\nhttp://vpsboard.com/index.php?/topic/378-catalysthost-2gb-trenta-kvm-vps-review/\r\nhttp://www.lowendhelp.com/catalyst-host-review/\r\nhttp://lowendtalk.com/discussion/7953/catalyst-host-review/\r\nhttp://lowendtalk.com/discussion/6030/catalyst-host-review/\r\nhttp://lowendtalk.com/discussion/8454/my-five-month-review-of-catalysthost\r\nhttp://lowendtalk.com/discussion/8654/review-catalyst-host/\r\nhttp://www.lowendbox.com/blog/catalysthost-17year-128mb-openvz-and-7-2gb-in-dallas-texas/#comments\r\n \r\nThanks guys, and rock on!\r\n \r\nHalfEatenPie"}
