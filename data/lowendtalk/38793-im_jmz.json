I was curious if anyone here got one and what the specs were if you did. The deal was $25 with a guaranteed minimum of 4GB RAM and 500GB HDD, can't remember the processor. 100Mbit line with 100TB bandwidth. I ended up getting: Xeon X3440, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD. Going to move over all sites from previous LEBs and my less-than-reliable OpenVZs from 123systems. \r\n\r\nAnyone else get one of these servers from Namecheap?"}
