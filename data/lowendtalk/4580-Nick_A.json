Our years of hosting experience as both clients and providers have inspired us to offer the kind of hosting that clients want at the kind of prices clients want to pay. Though our prices are low, performance is our main focus. We know that our best assets are our loyal customers, so we strive to provide hosting they will rave about to their fellow internet users. Our SSD and SSD-cached VPSs are perfect for a wide range of applications. With our top quality hardware, we can guarantee that our clients will get the most bang for their buck.\r\n\r\nOur SuperMicro enterprise grade servers are stocked with Intel 320 and Samsung 830 SSDs in lightning fast RAID10 arrays. Our servers provide incredible I/O as well as the safety of drive redundancy. We use powerful Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge E3 Quad Core processors on our VPS nodes. These CPUs run at a minimum 3.2GHz per core. CPU is allocated on a fair share basis per VPS, only limited by the number of cores in each plan.\r\n\r\nOur VPSs are hosted in **Atlanta**, GA and **Dallas**, TX.\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**VPS Features**\r\n\r\nIn addition to our great hardware, each VPS comes with the following features:\r\n\r\n**SolusVM control panel**\r\n**1Gbps fair share port speed**\r\n**INSTANT setup**\r\n**Daily remote backups**\r\n**TUN/TAP**\r\n**FUSE**\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**OpenVZ SSD VPS**\r\n\r\n**256MB SVZ**\r\nRAM: 256MB\r\nVSwap: 256MB\r\nCores: 1\r\n5GB RAID10 SSD Space\r\n500GB Bandwidth\r\n**Price**: -$15.00/qtr- **$10.50/qtr** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=1 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n**512MB SVZ**\r\nRAM: 512MB\r\nVSwap: 512MB\r\nCores: 2\r\n8GB RAID10 SSD Space\r\n1000GB Bandwidth\r\n**Price**: -$7.50/mo- **$5.25/mo** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=1 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**NEW OpenVZ SSD-Cached VPS**\r\n\r\n**256MB CVZ**\r\nRAM: 256MB\r\nVSwap: 256MB\r\nCores: 1\r\n30GB RAID10 SSD-Cached HDD Space\r\n500GB Bandwidth\r\n**Price**: -$15.00/qtr- **$10.50/qtr** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=3 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n**512MB CVZ**\r\nRAM: 512MB\r\nVSwap: 512MB\r\nCores: 2\r\n40GB RAID10 SSD-Cached HDD Space \r\n1000GB Bandwidth\r\n**Price**: -$7.50/mo- **$5.25/mo** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=3 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**KVM SSD and SSD-Cached Plans Coming Soon!**\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**FAQs**\r\n\r\n**How long does VPS setup take?**\r\nYour VPS will be setup **INSTANTLY** upon receipt of payment (unless we happen to be out of stock).
