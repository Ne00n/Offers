Head over to &lt;a href=\"http://gatsby.im\"&gt;Gatsby.im&lt;/a&gt; and get going now.\r\nAs this is an open beta, I'm incredibly interested in your thoughts, opinions, and suggestions for improvement- only through your feedback will Gatsby become the best place to host your blogs.\r\nNot interested?
