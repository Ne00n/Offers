Easy administration and multiple configuration options are available for a reasonable monthly cost.&lt;br&gt;Our anti-ddos infrastructure is built up on multiple mitigation layers. Bad traffic is filtered and reduced over several scrubbing layers, finally it gets filtered by the last member in our filtration chain. Beside typical scenarios like TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, GRE and other network based floods, our solution handles also Layer7 attacks which aim to overhelm your application with malicious request floods.\r\n\r\n*************************\r\nPlease check our plans below,\r\n*************************\r\n\r\n_D_512MB_V_ &lt;br&gt;\r\nPrice - $2.50/monthly &lt;br&gt;\r\nPromo - **$1.25/monthly**\r\n\r\nx1 CPU Core (E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz)\t&lt;br&gt;\r\n10 GB Hard DISK Space \t&lt;br&gt;\r\n512 MB RAM \t&lt;br&gt;\r\n512 MB SWAP\t&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv4&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv6 (/112)&lt;br&gt;\r\n100 GB Bandwidth&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualizor Panel Support&lt;br&gt;\r\nDDoS Protection Included&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://www.obhost.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=137)\r\n\r\n_D_2GB_V_ &lt;br&gt;\r\nPrice - $5.20/monthly &lt;br&gt;\r\nPromo - **$2.60/monthly**\r\n\r\nx2 CPU Core (E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz) &lt;br&gt;\r\n30 GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n2048 MB RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n2048 MB SWAP&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv4&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv6 (/112)&lt;br&gt;\r\n300 GB Bandwidth&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualizor Panel Support&lt;br&gt;\r\nDDoS Protection Included&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://www.obhost.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=138)\r\n\r\n_D_4GB_V_ &lt;br&gt;\r\nPrice - $10.60/monthly &lt;br&gt;\r\nPromo - **$5.30/monthly**\r\n\r\nx2 CPU Core (E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz) &lt;br&gt;\r\n50 GB Storage&lt;br&gt;\r\n4096 MB RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n4096 MB SWAP&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv4&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv6 (/112)&lt;br&gt;\r\n500 GB Bandwidth&lt;br&gt;\r\nVirtualizor Panel Support&lt;br&gt;\r\nDDoS Protection Included&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://www.obhost.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=139)\r\n*************************\r\nMore packages @ [OpenVZ VPS Hosting](https://www.obhost.net/linux-vps.php)\r\n*************************\r\nHave a question? \r\nPlease feel free to contact us (Support@obhost.org Or [Open a ticket](https://www.obhost.net/submitticket.php?step=2&amp;deptid=4))"}
