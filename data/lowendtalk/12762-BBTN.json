It's a 128MB OpenVZ in Buffalo (&lt;a href=https://my.frantech.ca/cart.php?gid=22&gt;actually sold out&lt;/a&gt;) pre paid until 31th of\r\nAugust.\r\nIf they, and a possible prospect agree, I'd let them transfer it to your account as I won't need\r\nit anymore.\r\nIf interested, see: http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/comment/55513#Comment_55513"}
