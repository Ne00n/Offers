After concentrating on the higher-end market in the past, we're now rushing into LEB market. We recently started a new VPS node which now needs to be filled. \r\n\r\nTherefore we created the following LowEndTalk special:\r\n**OpenVZ**\r\n**Location: Romania**\r\n**RAM: 96MB (128MB burstable)**\r\n**Disk: 10GB**\r\n**Traffic: 100GB**\r\n**IP: 1x IPv4, IPv6 soon(*)**\r\n**IRCd, VPN: allowed**\r\n**TUN/TAP enabled**\r\n\r\n**Payment via: Paypal, Bitcoin, Liberty Reserve**\r\n**During your order, simply choose one of the payment methods provided in WHMCS, you can pay the WHMCS invoice with Paypal even it's not on the list during the order. Normally, we provide Paypal payment only per request because of the hight fraud rates.**\r\n\r\nOrder via this direct link: https://www.support.cinipac.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=224. Orders are not instant due to fraud prevention, we're releasing each VPS individually. Due to our business hours activation should take about 15mins after payment, maximum 12h in extreme cases.\r\n\r\nIn the first batch we're releasing 20 of those LowEndBoxes. After all boxes are taken, you can express your interest and pre-order a LEB of the next batch with a simple mail to **lowendspecial@cinipac.com**\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nCINIPAC Hosting\r\n\r\n(*) IPv6 is currently not available on \"our\" datacenter. We try to get IPv6 by the end of 2012."}
