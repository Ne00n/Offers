The VDS is a virtual server with dedicated hardware resources and kernel and has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter,etc. It appears and behaves as a dedicated server but actually is installed on a cluster serving multiple virtual machines.\r\n\r\nIt's the perfect alternative to be chosen by small businesses that need a customized website but cannot afford a dedicated server. For example a website owner might use one server for the production-level website and the other for a \"dummy site\" that can be used to test planned updates, modifications or new programs\r\n\r\nWe use only ssd storage and KVM virtualization tehnology on powerfull nodes, so the performance of the vds is highly improved on each and every aspect.\r\n\r\n[All Pure SSD KVM VDS plans @ Virtono.com](https://www.virtono.com/ssd-kvm-vps)\r\nStarter - \u20ac5/month ( \u20ac3.75/month with coupon \"LET25VRT\" ) 1 Core Processor 512MB Memory 20GB SSD Disk Unlimited Bandwidth\r\n\r\n[**All Pure SSD KVM VDS plans @ Virtono.com**](https://www.virtono.com/ssd-kvm-vps)"}
