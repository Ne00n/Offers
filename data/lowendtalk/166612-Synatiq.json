We have a couple of exciting changes, and we\u2019re bringing back our much-loved $30 free credit for a limited time (we plan to keep this deal for 2 weeks, but we may have to end it sooner to keep our stock levels balanced).\r\n\r\nA couple of updates from our previous post:\r\n\r\n1. **Plesk (10 domains) Web Admin Edition** is now **included with all** Synatiq Cloud Instances! This is not the \"compromise\" of a free Plesk license Vultr, DO and AWS give you, this is the premium, 10 domain, fully-featured edition of Plesk! We think it is THE BEST control panel for web admins out there, and we can't wait for you to try it on our speedy, modern platform! We tried alternatives to Plesk, but we kept falling back in love with Plesk and we're confident you will do too.\r\n\r\n2. **We're bringing back our $30 free credit deal which many of you know and love!** And no, this is not the \"marketing trick of a deal\" that some leaders will feed you. **The redeemed credits will not expire** after a certain period like other competitors', they're yours to use even after a year.\r\n\r\n3. We know you've all been extremely eager to try our promised upcoming locations - Singapore and Paris. We're still working on those and we should hopefully have them ready in the next few weeks. Hint: a lot has to be done to make 10Gbps feasible in Singapore.\r\n\r\n4. London instances are connected on 10Gbps, while LA instances are currently capped at 1Gbps pending a free 10Gbps upgrade in the next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\n&gt; **What makes Synatiq Cloud Instances special?**\r\n* **$30 free credit** with voucher code **JOIN10** after your first transaction!\r\n* **Free Plesk Web Admin Edition** with all Synatiq Instances!\r\n* **10GBPS down/up** on all plans *(10Gbps in London, 1Gbps in LA - read point 4 above for info)\r\n* Pure **NVMe** storage\r\n* **Free weekly backups** and snapshots\r\n* Linux and Windows at no extra cost\r\n* DDoS protected\r\n* Flexible billing platform designed for developers\r\n* London and Los Angeles (Paris and Singapore coming soon)\r\n\r\n&gt; **How do I redeem the $30 free credit?**\r\n* Once you register, you will be asked to deposit funds to activate your Synatiq account. Once done, enter voucher **JOIN10** from Billing - Add Funds - Redeem Voucher to apply the free credit to your balance. (Note, this is different to the coupon code field during the VM deployment process)\r\n* The redeemed funds will not expire unlike some bigger players' free credit, it is not time limited and you can use it until it's fully applied to your instances within your specific billing period - daily, monthly, quarterly, etc.\r\n* **For example, deposit $10, apply the $30 free credit and get the next 6 months on us, or in other words 8 months of service for $10 USD.** ($5 plan used for the maths)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; **The plan:**\r\n\r\n$5 p/m\r\n25GB Storage\r\n1 Core\r\n1GB Memory\r\n1TB monthly bandwidth @ 10 GBPS up/down\r\nIn London only\r\nFree Plesk\r\nFree Windows\r\nFree Backups\r\n[Sign up](https://www.synatiq.com/cloud)\r\n\r\nAnd more with up to 128GB RAM.\r\n\r\n&gt; **How does it perform?**\r\n&gt; - London https://www.speedtest.net/result/c/ab3dbf83-4f30-4fcb-b68a-8a124d3f0a67\r\n&gt; - Los Angeles
