Our years of hosting experience as both clients and providers have inspired us to offer the kind of hosting that clients want at the kind of prices clients want to pay. Though our prices are low, performance is our main focus. We know that our best assets are our loyal customers, so we strive to provide hosting they will rave about to their fellow internet users. Our **SSD and SSD-cached VPSs** are perfect for a wide range of applications. With our top quality hardware, we can guarantee that our clients will get the most bang for their buck.\r\n\r\nOur SuperMicro enterprise grade servers are stocked with **Samsung 830 SSDs** in lightning fast, **LSI-powered RAID10** arrays. Our servers provide incredible I/O as well as the safety of drive redundancy. We use powerful Intel **Ivy Bridge E3-1230v2** Quad Core processors on our VPS nodes. These CPUs run at 3.3GHz per core. CPU is allocated on a fair share basis per VPS, only limited by the number of cores in each plan.\r\n\r\nOur VPSs are hosted in **Atlanta**, GA. Our servers are located at 55 Marietta, where we own all of our hardware and network.\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**VPS Features**\r\n\r\nIn addition to our great hardware, each VPS comes with the following features:\r\n\r\n* SolusVM control panel\r\n* 1Gbps fair share port speed\r\n* INSTANT setup\r\n* Daily remote backups\r\n* TUN/TAP\r\n* FUSE\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**OpenVZ SSD VPS**\r\n\r\n**256MB SVZ**\r\n\r\n* RAM: 256MB\r\n* VSwap: 256MB\r\n* Cores: 1\r\n* 5GB RAID10 SSD Space\r\n* 1 IPv4 Address\r\n* 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n* 500GB Bandwidth\r\n\r\n**Price**: &lt;del&gt;$15.00/qtr&lt;/del&gt; **$10.50/qtr** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=1 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n**512MB SVZ**\r\n\r\n* RAM: 512MB\r\n* VSwap: 512MB\r\n* Cores: 2\r\n* 10GB RAID10 SSD Space\r\n* 1 IPv4 Address\r\n* 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n* 1000GB Bandwidth\r\n\r\n**Price**: &lt;del&gt;$7.50/mo&lt;/del&gt; **$5.25/mo** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=1 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**OpenVZ SSD-Cached VPS**\r\n\r\n**256MB CVZ**\r\n\r\n* RAM: 256MB\r\n* VSwap: 256MB\r\n* Cores: 1\r\n* 30GB RAID10 SSD-Cached HDD Space\r\n* 1 IPv4 Address\r\n* 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n* 500GB Bandwidth\r\n\r\n**Price**: &lt;del&gt;$15.00/qtr&lt;/del&gt; **$10.50/qtr** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=3 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n**512MB CVZ**\r\n\r\n* RAM: 512MB\r\n* VSwap: 512MB\r\n* Cores: 2\r\n* 40GB RAID10 SSD-Cached HDD Space\r\n* 1 IPv4 Address\r\n* 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n* 1000GB Bandwidth\r\n\r\n**Price**: &lt;del&gt;$7.50/mo&lt;/del&gt; **$5.25/mo** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=3 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**KVM SSD VPS**\r\n\r\n**256MB SKVM**\r\n\r\n* RAM: 256MB\r\n* Cores: 1\r\n* 5GB RAID10 SSD Space\r\n* 1 IPv4 Address\r\n* 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n* 500GB Bandwidth\r\n\r\n**Price**: &lt;del&gt;$8.00/mo&lt;/del&gt; **$5.60/mo** |  [Order Now](https://clientarea.ramnode.com/cart.php?gid=4 \"Order Now\")\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**KVM SSD-Cached Plans Coming Soon!**\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n**FAQs**\r\n\r\n**How long does VPS setup take?**\r\nYour VPS will be setup **INSTANTLY** upon receipt of payment (unless we happen to be out of stock).
