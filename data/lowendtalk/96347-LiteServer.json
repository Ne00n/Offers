The amount of memory, storage and bandwidth are all \"balanced\".  \r\n  \r\n**#Traffic VPS Series:**  \r\nThese KVM/OpenVZ VPS series are mainly designed for clients who use their VPS for **high bandwidth** purposes. For example, shoutcast streaming servers or private VPNs. The traffic VPS series have SSD-Cached based storage, and will come with a lower amount of storage than our SSD / Storage VPS plans. In exchange for the lower amount of storage, you'll get double the amount of monthly bandwidth. When you are looking for a lot of bandwidth, while storage is less important, the traffic VPS series are the ones you're looking for!  \r\n  \r\n**#Storage VPS Series:**  \r\nOur storage series are ideal for people that require a **high amount of storage** (backups for example). These nodes have SSD Cached storage. Data that is frequently access will be stored on the cache SSDs, while the data which is less frequently accessed will run off the SATA drives. Average I/O performance will be close to that of our SSD plans, especially the data which is frequently being accessed.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Included with all VPS plans:**  \r\n- Instant setup  \r\n- 1Gbps shared uplink  \r\n- 1 IPv4 address  \r\n- /64 IPv6 subnet  \r\n- SolusVM VPS control panel  \r\n- Reverse DNS  \r\n\r\n\r\n**OpenVZ based LEB VPS plans:**  \r\n&gt;
