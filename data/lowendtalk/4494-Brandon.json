The goal of the Provision Panel is to provide a easy to use, interactive and intuitive user interface; for managing Provision Host services. The control panel, in it's Beta stage, currently offers: news updates, a client chat and file manager for VPS and Minecraft services. In order to login you must use your client area details. This is typically your e-mail address and password you use to login to: https://client.provisionhost.com/. \r\n\r\n &gt; Provision Panel URL: http://panel.provisionhost.com/index.php \r\n\r\n&gt;  Why did we create the Provision Panel? \r\n- Client Interaction \r\n- Added Functionality\r\n- Simplicity of Use\r\n\r\n&gt;  Current Features: \r\n\r\n&gt;  Chat: \r\nWe felt it was necessary to offer a way for clients to easily and effectively interact with each other and us. The traditional ticket systems are simply not as effective as providing support. In addition, clients may use this instead of our Live Chat (which is meant for pre-sales questions) and engage directly with support staff. *Hint: Staff are continually monitoring this. Clients that are seen to be helpful and informative to others may earn themselves cool perks like T-Shirts, discounts and even free months of services. \r\n\r\n&gt;  File Manager: \r\nAt Provision Host, we like to make things easier. In doing so, we've created a web based control panel for both VPS and Minecraft clients to use to help manage their servers. Please note that in order to use it, the login details must correspond to the ones we have on record. These are most likely the default ones which were initially created when your server was setup. \r\n\r\n&gt;  The Newsletter: \r\nStay up to date with the latest news from Provision Host. There are postings from both Twitter and our client area with lots of juicy information you may want to know. \r\n\r\n&gt;   If there is any feedback and suggestions, we would be more than happy to hear from you. Simply drop us an e-mail to: inquiries@provisionhost.com or speak to a staff member on chat. We are always looking to improve your experience here at Provision Host and look forward to releasing future updates to the Provision Panel."}
