FYI, I have a vps on the box using the remaining resources.\r\n\r\nThe offer:\r\n\r\n1 dedicated cpu @ 2.8Ghz (i5 2300)\r\n\r\nThe cpu can be used completely all the time without being suspended, since the allocation is dedicated to your vps.\r\n\r\n4gb ddr3 ram\r\n200GB disk space\r\nIPv4 address\r\nOpenVZ + CP\r\n50mbit in / 50mbit out unmetered\r\nddos protection\r\n\r\nAll the above resources are dedicated.\r\n\r\nHosted at OVH rbx. Use should be in line with the OVH dedicated server TOS and AUP. So nothing illegal. Limited offer, only 2 available.\r\nI'm selling these slices to make better use of the available resources on the server.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny interest?"}
