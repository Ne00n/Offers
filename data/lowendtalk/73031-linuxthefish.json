I'm running these offers through the provider I work for, DediStation.com. DediStation has UK and native Chinese support, and offers budget VPS servers with offers and support different from what you might get direct at OVH.\r\n\r\nThese offers are located at OVH Canada, on a 256gb DDR3 with single E5-1620s and 6x 7200rpm SAS drives in RAID10 with 1Gbps guaranteed bandwidth (\"Premium Bandwidth OVH/Internet\"). No SLA guarantee on these offers, but if a node goes down all VPS's affected get a free month of service. This does not cover DDoS attacks, but the node is covered by OVH's anti DDoS and we can customise permanent mitigation or firewall rules as required.\r\n\r\n&gt; [Canada OpenVZ Unlimited - $15 Yearly - Click here to sign up!](https://dedistation.com/billing/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=9&amp;product=11)\r\n&gt; ================\r\n&gt; * 768MB DDR3 RAM\r\n&gt; * 10GB RAID10 Disk Space\r\n&gt; * 1 CPU Core\r\n&gt; * Unlimited bandwidth @ 100Mbps\r\n&gt; * 1 IPv4 Address, 5 IPv6 Addresses\r\n&gt; * Canada, OVH Datacenter\r\n\r\n---\r\n&gt; [Canada OpenVZ 3GB Yearly - $15 Yearly - Click here to sign up!](https://dedistation.com/billing/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=9&amp;product=12)\r\n&gt; ================\r\n&gt; * 3GB DDR3 RAM\r\n&gt; * 50GB RAID10 Disk Space\r\n&gt; * 2 CPU Cores\r\n&gt; * 5TB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps\r\n&gt; * 1 IPv4 Address, 10 IPv6 Addresses\r\n&gt; * Canada, OVH Datacenter\r\n\r\n---\r\n&gt; [Canada OpenVZ Jonny 7GB - $7 Monthly - Click here to sign up!](https://dedistation.com/billing/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=9&amp;product=13)\r\n&gt; ================\r\n&gt; * 7GB DDR3 RAM\r\n&gt; * 100GB RAID10 Disk Space\r\n&gt; * 4 CPU Cores\r\n&gt; * Unlimited bandwidth @ 100Mbps (Ticket to change to 30TB@1Gbps)\r\n&gt; * 1 IPv4 Address, 20 IPv6 Addresses\r\n&gt; * Canada, OVH Datacenter\r\n\r\nCanada Test IPv4: 192.99.19.165   \r\nCanada Test File: http://192.99.19.165/files/100Mio.dat"}
