My endeavour is simple: to provide a viable alternative VPS solution for anyone who needs a high-performance SSD VPS here in the UK.\r\n\r\nI've created a customised configuration using the latest solid state drives to deliver up to 240K IOPS or around 1.5-2GB/s of disk IO for the most demanding applications. To put that into perspective, that's around 200x faster than a typical hard disk, and around 2-4x faster than a typical solid state drive.\r\n\r\nVPSs are hosted on server-grade hardware with Intel Xeon E3 processors, DDR3 memory and fast, UK bandwidth. I have set up these servers using the KVM virtualisation software to enable full management, and OnApp control panel for complete autonomy. Daily backups to RAID6 NAS are included free of charge.\r\n\r\n**256MB RAM\r\n3GB SSD\r\n100GB Bandwidth\r\n\u00a34.30/month ($7 USD) with coupon LOWENDBOX\r\n[Order](https://virt.io/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1)**\r\n\r\nTest IP: 91.227.221.128\r\nTest Download: [100MB](http://91.227.221.128/100mb.bin)\r\nData Centre: Custodian DC in Kent, UK (Level3 Bandwidth!)"}
