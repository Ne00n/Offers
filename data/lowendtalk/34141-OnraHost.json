How will it work? Well in order to maintain my distance from this and make sure 100% of the proceeds go to Duke:\r\n\r\n1. Simply donate at least $3 using the official link: http://www.gofundme.com/d5uzbw\r\n2. Send us a screenshot of your confirmation page through PM\r\n3. We will supply you with a link to signup and you will receive credit of the same amount donated :)             \r\n*$50 credit maximum. If more then $50 please contact us on what service you will be using*                                                                     \r\n*New and existing customers.
