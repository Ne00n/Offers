The box is on a great node as I have experienced absolutely zero downtime except for some maintenance reboots, it is on the S3-NY node. Id rather not let good pricing goto waste so if anyone is interested in taking over shoot me a PM (first come first serve) you can take possession of the VPS sometime midweek next week.\r\n\r\nvps expires: Nov 16, 2014\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yNEpdAA.jpg)"}
