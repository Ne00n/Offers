We've recently added Miami, Florida to our growing list of US based locations, perfect for our friends in South America who wish to have a better connection to their homes. We're happy to be running our first promotion available in our Florida location! In a place less sunny than Florida (The UK) we've reintroduced new stock in Maidenhead. In our previous promotions we did not list Maidenhead, UK as an option due to insufficient stock but we're happy to offer it to you once more. And because Los Angeles continues to be one of our most popular VPS locations, we'll offer it as part of this promotion as well!\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Look at these deals!&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\nLook at what $30/YR will get you, now that's a heck of a deal.\r\n\r\n\u2022 1536MB RAM // 1536MB Burst\r\n\u2022 45GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022 1 IPv4 Address\r\n\u2022 500GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022 100Mbps Port\r\n\u2022 OpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n\u2022 Price: &lt;b&gt;$30/YR&lt;/b&gt; (after coupon)\r\n\u2022 Coupon Code: LETMAR2013\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Location Choices (choose in order form):&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\u2022 Maidenhead, UK\r\n\u2022 Miami, FL\r\n\u2022 Los Angeles, CA\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;[&lt;a href=\"https://billing.urpad.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=241&amp;promocode=LETMAR2013\"&gt;Order Now&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hgwOXpA.jpg\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nDue to the success of our recent $6.95/mo for 2GB RAM deal, we've decided to continue offering it as an ongoing LET/LEB promotion.\r\n\r\n\u2022 2048MB RAM // 2048MB Burst\r\n\u2022 50GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022 1 IPv4 Address\r\n\u2022 750GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022 100Mbps Port\r\n\u2022 OpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n\u2022 Price: &lt;b&gt;$6.95/mo&lt;/b&gt; (after coupon)\r\n\u2022 Coupon Code: LETMAR2013\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Location Choices (choose in order form):&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\u2022 Maidenhead, UK\r\n\u2022 Miami, FL\r\n\u2022 Los Angeles, CA\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;[&lt;a href=\"https://billing.urpad.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=237&amp;promocode=LETMAR2013\"&gt;Order Now&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThese offers are only designed as a Limited time deal and will expire once stock is filled.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Network Test:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, CA \u2013 QuadraNet Datacenter \u2013 Test IP: 98.143.159.202\r\nMiami, FL - QuadraNet Datacenter - Test IP: 173.44.32.20\r\nMaidenhead, UK - Pulsant Datacenter - Test IP: 78.157.192.2\r\n\r\nURPad.net is owned by an established parent (FTNHosting) which manages multiple web hosting brands and has been in business for 5 years.
