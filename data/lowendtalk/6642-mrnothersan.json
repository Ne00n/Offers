You don't need to know an awful lot about Linux to host with us - we'll do quite a bit of the work for you as we include Basic Management with all hosting plans (yes, even LEB's).\r\n\r\n**Explanation:**\r\n\r\nYou may not have heard anything about the launch. After SwitchVM being a slight disaster, I was determined to do something right and make something work. I now have got things how I like them, and I am determined not to let this fail! I've been working on this silently so as to not cause too much drama. Now that everything has launched, I am determined and want you to know that this will not fail. I've gone with a deal in Continuum, Chicago so as to keep costs low in order to pass the costs on to customers. PremiumVM is different. We're not using the normal SolusVM combination, we're using Virtualizor which I find much easier to use! If you have any questions regarding this, please do not cause drama in this offers thread. I'd be happy to answer any questions via PM/email (admin@premiumvm.com).\r\n\r\n**LET Plans:**\r\n\r\npVM 1 - OpenVZ\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;15 GB Disk Space&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;250 GB Bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;256 MB Guaranteed RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;512 MB Burstable RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;4 CPU Cores&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Basic Management (included)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Virtualizor Control Panel&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://www.premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2) - $3.50 per month **(use coupon: LEBChristmas)**\r\n\r\npVM2 - OpenVZ\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;30 GB Disk Space&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;500 GB Bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;512 MB Guaranteed RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1 GB Burstable RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;4 CPU Cores&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Basic Management (included)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Virtualizor Control Panel&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://www.premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3) - $6.50 per month **(use coupon: LEBChristmas)**\r\n\r\nLEB Exclusive - OpenVZ\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;10 GB Disk Space&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;200 GB Bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;128 MB Guaranteed RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;256 MB Burstable RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;2 CPU Cores&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Basic Management (included)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Virtualizor Control Panel&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://www.premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5) - $5.50 per quarter **(use coupon: LEBExclusive)**\r\n\r\n**Test IP's/Files:**\r\n\r\nTest Files: http://testfiles.premiumvm.com/\r\n\r\n**Payment Methods:**\r\n\r\nCurrently PayPal is the only method of payment accepted, however we are looking into alternative options such as 2Checkout.\r\n\r\n**Activation:**\r\n\r\nProvided you pass the automated fraud check, activation should be instant.\r\n\r\n**Contact Information:**\r\n\r\nEmail: sales@premiumvm.com\r\nTicket: http://www.premiumvm.com/clients/submitticket.php?step=2&amp;deptid=1\r\nVia a PM\r\nLive chat on the homepage\r\nDirect: admin@premiumvm.com\r\n\r\nAs I said, I'd welcome any questions you have about the creation of PremiumVM to the admin@ email address, or via a PM.
