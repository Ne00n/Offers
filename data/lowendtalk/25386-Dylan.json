This is the 128MB/128MB, 1 core, 15GB HDD, 500GB BW OpenVZ plan in New Jersey. The next due date is 10/01/2014 and it's $15/year.\r\n\r\n**I'm asking $6.**\r\n\r\nYou do need to be an active BuyVM customer to receive the transfer and meet the criteria in section 4.2 here: https://my.frantech.ca/tos.php (active with at least three months of continuous service history, no unpaid or overdue invoices, no TOS/AUP Violations on record)."}
