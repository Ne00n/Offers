Meaning no more than 5 minutes a week in downtime.\r\n\r\nI currently have two vps servers at JollyWorks Florida location which actually use the Volume Drive data center in Florida somewhere. They are great and cheap and always and everything but only 500 gigabytes of monthly transfer each and will not according to them if I go over I'm at the expensive per gigabyte rate.\r\n\r\nI was considering possibly one of the volume drive vps servers at the same data center since they have some high data transfer vpses or possibly fastvps.co. My only concern is that I dont see to many positive feedback ratings about either company on here just only negative stuff on lowendtalk and webhostingtalk.\r\n\r\nOh and I don't need much cpu or ram either just an fyi. Just good solid network and lots of bandwidth in Florida.\r\n\r\nThanks"}
