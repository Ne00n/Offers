Each day (including Christmas day) we'll post a daily offer. These are only good for the day. Since we're late in posting this today, I included our Dual Intel Xeon 5420 Black Friday offer as well. There is VERY limited 5420 units left, so enjoy it if you snag one.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCheck back each day as I will post the daily deals in here. Daily deals will be across all of our products. Today are dedicated server deals. Future daily deals may also be dedicated server deals, colocation deals, storage box deals....or even freebies :)  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe usual rules apply. All offers are valid today only (December 19th 2018 - CST time zone). Once inventory runs out, they are gone. Offers cannot be used to replace an existing service and cannot be used to price match existing servers. New orders only. Offers will not be honored after the promotional period. Unpaid orders are cancelled after 24 hours.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Dual Intel Xeon E5-2660v1**  \r\nCPU: 2.2Ghz / 3.0Ghz Turbo - 2 Processors (16 Cores / 32 Threads)  \r\nMemory: 64GB DDR3 RAM  \r\nStorage: 1x 480GB SSD  \r\nBandwidth: 1Gbit Port: 100TB/Month  \r\nIPs: 5 Usable IPv4 (IPv6 available on request)  \r\nLocation: Missouri (USA)  \r\n  \r\nBONUS OFFER: Mention \"$5 LET Credit\" in the order notes for a free $5 credit good towards any invoices on your account.
