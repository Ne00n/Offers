So far managed to sell 5 out of the 8 I have for sale.\r\nReason for sale as specified on my other vps offer page, I have moved a lot of the projects off my collection of small vps onto a dedicated machine and larger more powerful Virtual Servers. \r\n\r\nBoth VPS are with Alienvps, I managed to avoid problems which others have had and their support has always been great.\r\n\r\n1) 192MB Ram, 19GB HDD , 190GB Bandwidth, New york. Paid $19 until July 9th. Yours for $8!\r\n2) 192MB Ram, 19GB HDD , 190GB Bandwidth, Las Vegas. Paid $15 until August 9th. Yours for $10!\r\n\r\nWill sell both for $15.\r\nI have still got a further few vps with alienvps, and they have been preforming nicely considering the price.\r\n\r\nAll offers considered.\r\n\r\nPaypal only."}
