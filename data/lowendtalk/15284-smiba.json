The price will not be affected after the offer has expired.\r\n\r\nOur servers are located in hetzner's datacenter in Nuremberg, Germany which will give us a stable connection. Also we do not oversell our memory, which can cause instability.\r\n\r\nThe site is written in dutch as we are mostly active in the Benelux. Users from other countries are welcome but may need to use google translate now and then. We can answer support tickets in English and whmcs can be set to English. \r\n\r\n**Be sure to use the promo code \"LEB15OFF\" Before Compleating your order!**\r\n\r\n**512MB**\r\n\r\nOne 2660Mhz Core&lt;br /&gt;\r\nDiskspace: 50GB (RAID1)&lt;br /&gt;\r\nRAM: 512MB&lt;br /&gt;\r\nvSwap: 64MB&lt;br /&gt;\r\nBandwidth: 200GB @ 250Mbit&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 adress\r\n\r\n\u20ac4,70 ($6,42)- Order [NL](https://www.smibahosting.nl/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=26&amp;language=Dutch)   [EN](https://www.smibahosting.nl/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=26&amp;language=English) "}
