While most providers out there only offer Linux, we feel that there is a small but significant market out there for NetBSD VPSes.\n\nAlso remember that our \u00a33.50 off coupon code \"LEB2011Autumn\" (which makes plans start from as low as \u00a32.49 per month) is still available: http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/evorack-2-49-128mb-xen-vps-in-uk-2/\n\nIf anyone has any questions, please feel free to post here or open a ticket at http://www.Evorack.com\n\nThanks,\n\nJonny"}
