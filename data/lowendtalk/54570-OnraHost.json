To even turn a profit with this model, they must host at least 30 - 50 reseller accounts\u2026.on ONE server! This also means they would need a minimum of 3TB - 5TB of space; Onra would bet money that most, if not all, have no where near that storage capacity on their servers. \r\n\r\nNow your asking, why would they offer those plans then? Cause they bet on YOU, to not use YOUR space, YOUR are entitled to! More importantly, add the fact that now thousands of domains are also going to be hosted on that server with all the other reseller servers. Around the end of the first year, you can rest assured your server will come halting to a snails pace, as the server reaches and surpasses maximum capacity\u2026..if its not doing that already\u2026\r\n\r\nAt Onra, we only sell to 80% capacity! This means, your server will NEVER run out of storage space, even when users upgrade their packages with us. More importantly, this means you can always rest assured YOUR server's performance will be running at 100%, 100% of the time!!! We bet on YOU using ALL your resources ;). \r\n\r\nIn short, this allows us to provide a excellent level of quality not only now, but for years, and years to come!
