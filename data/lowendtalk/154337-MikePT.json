They're in good hands, but actually, it was a very fun ride (while it lasted), so we thought of continuing to work with MailChannels but this time not reselling the service, instead, we launched a brand that consists of sending email, done right.\r\nHere are a few reasons to consider using our services:\r\n\r\n- All emails are sent using MailChannels to ensure the best deliverability possible;\r\n- Our servers consist of RAID 10 SSD Arrays, even for emails;\r\n- Full White-label service - IRoute.io is only seen in our Console, where cPanel, CrossBox and MX servers are pure, beautiful white-label (and using a white-label domain);\r\n- CrossBox included with all accounts;\r\n- Public status page for full transparency regarding the quality of our service: https://status.iroute.io\r\n- Dallas location, more locations coming soon;\r\n- GDPR Compliant Company and Servers (Including JetBackup with enabled GDPR);\r\n- Single server hostname for IMAP/POP3/SMTP, no matter the server you're assigned to, this is a functionality we suggested to the guys at CrossBox and they've done it!\r\n- Daily backups with the ability to self-restore, download backups and such, using JetBackup;\r\n- Stickers will come soon ;-)\r\n- Beautiful Console, we spent quite some time working on its UI to improve its efficiency;\r\n- Support provided by Geeks;\r\n- Ex-largest MailChannels Resellers, meaning that you'll get top-notch service with guaranteed solutions for any issue you may experience.\r\n\r\nHere's our recommended package for LET:\r\n\r\n**20 GB SSD Storage\r\nUnlimited Domains\r\nUnlimited Email Accounts\r\nMailChannels Email Delivery\r\nWhite-label CrossBox, cPanel, MX**\r\n\r\n5\u20ac per month - [Order now!](https://iroute.io/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=53)\r\nOr 50\u20ac per year, make sure to apply the coupon: TWOMONTHSFREE\r\n_Plus VAT if applicable._\r\nOther plans available at [https://iroute.io](https://iroute.io)\r\n\r\nAbout IRoute.IO:\r\nIRoute.IO is a division of WNDP - WebNeg\u00f3cio Lda., an IT/Design company located in Portugal.
