You can get the book using this coupon link: http://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops/c/31WReDAfGxSZ\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to let me know what you think about the book here, via email, via Twitter, etc. I'd love to hear what this community, especially, thinks\u2014half my infrastructure testing is done on LEB hosts like RamNode, BlueVM, etc., so I owe a lot to this community!"}
