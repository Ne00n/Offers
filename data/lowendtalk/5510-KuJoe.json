Just use the link below to order and I'll manually approve the orders as they come in. Since these are free and for testing, there will not be instant setup like our other plans. If you have any feedback then please post it here or PM me. Additionally, if you wish to also test out one of our new DDOS Protected IPs please PM me if you have a website you wish to protect and I will work with you to get that setup with your test VPS. Thanks!\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://my.securedragon.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=74\"&gt;Direct order link&lt;/a&gt;"}
