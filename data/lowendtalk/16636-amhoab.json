As part of that effort, I am not planning to renew this VPS, despite it being a good performer.\r\n\r\nI was moved to the Black Lotus facility in LA (i.e. free DDoS protection) after the UrPad migration, and haven't had any downtime since (although it was honestly pretty good before).  It's been slightly less than a month since the migration, though, so take that into account.\r\n\r\nThis VPS expires 11/27/2013.  I am giving it away for free if only one person asks for it.  Otherwise, it'll be an auction starting at $1.  This ends midnight (EST) Saturday.\r\n\r\nIf interested, just say so right here (i.e. not via PM).  Hopefully someone can make good use of this."}
