My non-MySQL-node Multicraft panel (which gets about 2 DDoS attacks / week) is located on one of their VPSes. I will need to have another place to store my panel for the 17th to the 19th.\r\n\r\nHere are the requirements:\r\n- 512MB of RAM\r\n- ~2GB of HDD space\r\n- CentOS (5 or 6 is fine)\r\n- DDoS Protection (This is a MUST, I do not want the move to be an opportunity for network attacks)\r\n\r\nLocation: Preferably in CoreSite in SJ (Where my equipment is located, as well as BuyVMs). It must be within 500 miles of CoreSite @ SJ (LA, LV, etc.).\r\n\r\nDuration: 17th to 19th January 2013.\r\n\r\nPrice: $5 MAX (I'm only using it for 3 days)\r\n\r\n\r\nAny offers?"}
