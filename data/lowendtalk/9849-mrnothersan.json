As you will see by my other LET thread, we're relaunching and we're kicking off with 2 deals you just can't miss. We can guarantee you will get to use **all** your resources. Yes, that's right - there is **no overselling**. Some providers call their services \"unmanaged\" and then don't give you any support at all. We advertise \"basic\" management - this means that your services aren't fully managed, however we won't leave you in the dark. We will help you. We have more great deals to come, but this one won't last long so grab one before stock runs out.\r\n\r\nLocation: Columbus, OH (XLHost)\r\nTest IP: On request (ticket/PM)\r\nTest File: On request (ticket/PM)\r\nTOS: http://premiumvm.com/terms.html\r\n**IPv6 is available upon request (via ticket)**\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1GB @ $4&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n30GB Disk Space\r\n350GB Bandwidth\r\n1GB RAM\r\n1.5GB Burstable RAM (or vSwap)\r\n4 CPU Cores\r\nOpenVZ Virtualization\r\nChoice of Linux OS's\r\n1 IP Address (more available upon request)\r\n\r\n$4.00/month - &lt;a href=\"https://premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1\"&gt;Order Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2GB @ $6&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n30GB Disk Space\r\n350GB Bandwidth\r\n2GB RAM\r\n2.5GB Burstable RAM (or vSwap)\r\n4 CPU Cores\r\nOpenVZ Virtualization\r\nChoice of Linux OS's\r\n1 IP Address (more available upon request)\r\n\r\n$6.00/month - &lt;a href=\"https://premiumvm.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2\"&gt;Order Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n**Other useful information:**\r\n\r\nAll packages are upgradable, submit a ticket for pricing.
