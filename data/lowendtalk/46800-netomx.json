It runs Softether, so it supports:\r\n\r\n - SSTP\r\n - L2TP w/ and w/o encryption\r\n - OpenVPN with multiple ports\r\n - VPN over ICMP\r\n - Softether VPN\r\n\r\nCurrently, webpage is in a WIP, and the Control Panel is simple, but functional. \r\n\r\nThe free codes are tied to an email address, so there's just 1 code per email. They expire in 24 hours after the activation. also, there's a 100MB quota on every account, and then it will be suspended. You can check your current usage in the control panel. Please, no disposable emails.\r\n\r\nI will just gather your email address, the password is hashed with **password_hash** PHP function.\r\n\r\nRequest your access code here: https://www.routervpn.us/cp/request.php\r\n\r\nControl panel: https://www.routervpn.us/cp/\r\n\r\nSteps: \r\n\r\n1. Request a code\r\n2. Enter to the CP and register a new account.\r\n\r\nPLEASE report bugs to: webmaster@routervpn.us\r\n\r\nPrices MAY BE:\r\n\r\nDate - MB - Price\r\n1 day - 100MB - $1\r\n30 days - 500MB - $3\r\n90 days - 1.5GB - $5\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nP.S. I **may** add a function to send an email to receive a free 20MB, just to log and pay for the service. Useful if you're already in a blocked country."}
