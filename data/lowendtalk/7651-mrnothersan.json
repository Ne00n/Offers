Rack rails are included with this sale. This server was purchased with the Dell 1 year warranty, and has till July left. (expires around the 11th July). This server will be pulled from a datacenter, however it's hardly been used at all as it was an \"impulse buy\". It's been powered on, but it's been mainly sitting idle.\r\n\r\nI am looking for **\u00a3185-\u00a3195** for this + delivery (\u00a310-\u00a315 via courier to UK only), and I am open to negotiation as I want to sell this. I can be contacted via this thread or via a PM.\r\n\r\nIf required, I can email interested persons the full Dell order confirmation including the full order details (and more detailed specifications). Please send me an email if you require this. This cost over \u00a3400 new, so it's a bargain!\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDominic"}
