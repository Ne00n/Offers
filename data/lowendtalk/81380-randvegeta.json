I'm not all that keen to ship things overseas since I don't have a lot of packing materials and these servers can weigh quite a bit. But if you're really interested I'd consider.\r\n\r\nSo we plan to replace most of our old stock for new Xeon E3 v5s and this leaves us with some old stuff we no long wish to keep.\r\n\r\nAlmost everything we are looking to part with is a 2U server.\r\n\r\nItems vary, but we have things like\r\n\r\nCore2Duo E6550, 3GB RAM, 160GB HDD  2U servers. If you dont want/need the 2U chassis or power supply then we can make it very cheap for this kind of old stuff.\r\n\r\nGot various i3/i5/i7 from various generations. e.g. i3-550 and i7-4770. \r\n\r\nGot a bunch of Xeon E3-1200v2 and v3 models.\r\n\r\nI can provide a more complete list if there are people interested. I know there are a few lurkers from HK, so I'm mainly looking to see if anyone is interested. Available for collection or delivery! If interested I will list more details. But there is quite a selection. "}
