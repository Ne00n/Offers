The options are too many to be listed here, everyone can check them on the plans link. The difference from the old plan (the Eco1) is that this one can have up to two 3.5\" HDDs.\r\n\r\nServers location: &lt;a href=\"http://goo.gl/maps/wWd74\"&gt;Varna, Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nThese are the links to the previous offers, for your reference:\r\nhttp://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/8326/atom-n2800-from-25month\r\nhttp://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/8926/dual-core-4-threads-1.86ghz-atom-n2800-with-4gb-ram-from-25month\r\n\r\nSome background: Company name Telecoms Ltd., registered in it's current form since 1998. Operating own network - AS16154. RIPE LIR since 2000. Our main business is ISP.\r\n\r\nCurrently sales of the dedicated servers are handled under the FitVPS brand.\r\n\r\nThe previous promotions are over, so here is a new promotion:\r\nUse the coupon code &lt;b&gt;FreeUSBKey16GB&lt;/b&gt; to get a free 16GB USB stick attached to your\r\nserver. Ideal for temporarily storing backups, etc. The promotion expires on May 31st 2013.\r\n\r\nTo get this server You should not order directly on the website, instead you PM me if you are interested and i will tell you how to proceed.\r\nNormally we should do ID verification for the dedicated servers and i don't like this at all. So i am going to take personal responsibility for the few persons who will get this offer, however i also get to choose who can get it and who can't. I will check your past history on LET, etc. to decide if you\r\nare eligible for skipping the ID verification.\r\nStill full MaxMind and phone verification is mandatory for all orders.\r\n\r\nRespected LET community members get preference.\r\nCurrent or past customers with account in good standing get preference.\r\nRegistered companies get preference.\r\n\r\nHere is what the different HDD options currently means (not guaranteed to be the same in the future):\r\n\r\n\r\n30GB SSD\t\u00a0        A-DATA\r\n250GB 2.5\" 5400RPM HDD\t\u00a0Seagate ST9250315AS\r\n750GB 2.5\" 7200RPM HDD\t\u00a0Seagate ST9750420AS\r\n1TB Enterprise 3.5\" HDD\t\u00a0Seagate constellantion ES ST1000NM011\r\n2TB 3.5\" HDD\t\u00a0        Seagate SV35 ST2000VX000\r\n3TB 3.5\" HDD\t\u00a0        Seagate SV35 ST3000VX000\r\n120GB SSD\t\u00a0        Intel 520 series\r\n\r\nRemote power management is included (power OFF / power ON / power cycle).\r\nInstalls are automated, via the NOC-PS system. We can help with the initial installation in case it is something not handled by NOC-PS.\r\nWindows is not available.\r\n\r\nThis plan comes with either 1 IP address or 5 IP addresses for free. However if you want more than 1 IP address a subnet will be assigned to you according to the RIPE rules, which means your name and other details will be publicly visible in the RIPE database. There is no privacy option for the\r\nRIPE database.\r\n\r\nI am sure there are many questions that i haven't thought of, so ask and i will try to answer.\r\n\r\nThis offer will currently be posted on LET only.\r\n\r\nSome other information: test-ip - https://www.fitvps.com/test-ip\r\nLooking glass: http://lg.fitvps.com\r\nNetwork info: http://bgp.he.net/AS16154\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nStay tuned for some other offers in the future. We are testing more configurations, with different CPUs, more HDDs, etc.\r\n"}
