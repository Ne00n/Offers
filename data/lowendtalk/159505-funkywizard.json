I upgraded hardware once, adding a SSD for performance reasons. The upgrade went very smoothly, Gabriel asked me when we should start, gave an estimate how long it'd take from then on, and how exactly the update would take place, and - well, that's exactly how it happened. No problems at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n[http://mlpforums.com/topic/21625-welcome-to-the-new-server/](http://mlpforums.com/topic/21625-welcome-to-the-new-server/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company behind this awesome new server is I/O Flood. I want to take the time to give a special thanks to Gabe, who has been extremely helpful over the past couple of weeks in getting everything set up and ready to go for us in tip-top shape, offered me an amazing deal, and has gone above and beyond the level of service you'd normally expect from a hosting company.\r\n\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1037123](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1037123)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7197659&amp;postcount=8](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7197659&amp;postcount=8)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1063124](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1063124)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?p=7327776](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?p=7327776)\r\n\r\n[http://mlpforums.com/topic/21625-welcome-to-the-new-server/](http://mlpforums.com/topic/21625-welcome-to-the-new-server/)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7259254&amp;postcount=19](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7259254&amp;postcount=19)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1037123](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1037123)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1029536](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1029536)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?p=7221370](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?p=7221370)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7215169&amp;postcount=36](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7215169&amp;postcount=36)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7211725&amp;postcount=29](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7211725&amp;postcount=29)\r\n\r\n[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7211659&amp;postcount=15](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7211659&amp;postcount=15)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\n_**Why Choose I/O Flood?**\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI/O FLOOD exists to help entrepreneurs start and grow successful small businesses.
