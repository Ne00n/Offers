And, as with all Stillery services, our plan is to be **fully transparent** about what we offer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith our Plan 1 at **$7/month**, you get:\r\n\r\n- 1/2 thread (shared with one other VPS, but burstable up to 1 thread)\r\n    - E3-1270v3 @ 3.5GHz (turbo up to 3.9GHz)\r\n- 1GB ECC RAM\r\n- 15GB pure SSD RAID10 storage\r\n- 1TB @ 1Gbps bandwidth\r\n    - QuickPacket in Los Angeles, CA\r\n        - [AS46261](http://bgp.he.net/AS46261)\r\n        - [Looking glass](http://lg.lax.quickpacket.com/)\r\n    - 1 IPv4, IPv6 support (more available upon request)\r\n- KVM virtualization with fully custom management panel\r\n\r\n[**Sign up here!**](https://sigma.stillery.co)\r\n\r\nWe also have some higher-end plans with dedicated threads on our website.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBecause we oversell absolutely nothing, we can only fit *at most* 16 nodes per host! In this case, stock is limited to this as well.\r\n\r\nA warning that we do not guarantee support response times (though we do try to be quick &amp; friendly!), and **all VMs are manually approved and created**. Be patient as it may take up to 24-48 hours.\r\n\r\nFinally: **we're human too**! So if you have *any* questions, comments, or issues, do *not* hesitate to email us at [support@stillery.co](mailto:support@stillery.co). Or, PM me here if that's what you prefer."}
