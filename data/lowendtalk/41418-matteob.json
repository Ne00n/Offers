The goal of a CDN is to serve content to end-users with high availability and high performance. CDNs serve a large fraction of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social networks.\r\n\r\nBenefit?\r\n\r\nCDNs focus on improving performance of web page delivery. CDNs like InfinityCDN support progressive downloads, which optimizes delivery of digital assets such as web page images. CDN nodes and servers are deployed in multiple locations around the globe over multiple Internet backbones. These nodes cooperate with each other to satisfy data requests by end users, transparently moving content to optimize the delivery process. The larger the size and scale of a CDN's Edge Network deployments, the better the CDN.\r\n\r\n- Because closer is better, web caches store popular content closer to the user. These shared network appliances reduce bandwidth requirements, reduce server load, and improve the client response times for content stored in the cache.\r\n\r\n[InfinityCDN](http://www.domflow.it/cdn.php)) can detect DoS and SQL injection and will filter for you\r\n\r\nCheckout our [InfinityCDN page for details](http://www.domflow.it/cdn.php))\r\n\r\nHow to implement InfinityCDN? \r\n\r\n- Register for free [here https://www.domflow.it/cart.php?gid=13](https://www.domflow.it/cart.php?gid=13) (if you had an active CloudFlow account, jump this step)\r\n\r\n- Create your first resource, is easy [follow this howto](http://www.domflow.it/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=112)\r\n\r\n- Integrate [infinityCDN in your website](http://www.domflow.it/knowledgebase.php?action=displaycat&amp;catid=25).
