Several months ago we launched our Windows VPS plans and after hearing your feedback, you wanted faster drives. Today we're presenting an offer for our new SSD-cached line of Windows plans. We use SolusVM for management, and KVM virtualization. While Windows 2012 R2 comes standard, you may select CentOS and Ubuntu as well. You may select the location of the datacenter you prefer, but currently, we've only deployed the Dallas location. Phoenix will be coming up in the next few days for these plans.\r\n\r\n**WinPRO LITE**&lt;br /&gt;\r\n768MB DDR3 RAM&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 vCore @ 3.6GHz&lt;br /&gt;\r\n20GB SSD-Cached&lt;br /&gt;\r\n500GB Bandwidth&lt;br /&gt;\r\n100Mbps&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4&lt;br /&gt;\r\nWindows Server 2012 R2 (Licensed, Free)&lt;br /&gt;\r\nSolusVM Management&lt;br /&gt;\r\n99.9% Uptime&lt;br /&gt;\r\n[Order Now $3/M](https://virmach.com/manage/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=71&amp;promocode=LETWINPROLITE) - _Save $4.50_ &lt;br /&gt;\r\nCOUPON CODE **LETWINPROLITE**\r\n\r\n**WinPRO X1+**&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1GB DDR3 RAM&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 vCore @ 3.6GHz&lt;br /&gt;\r\n24GB SSD-Cached&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1TB Bandwidth&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1Gbps&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 - Additional Available&lt;br /&gt;\r\nWindows Server 2012 R2 (Licensed, Free)&lt;br /&gt;\r\nSolusVM Management&lt;br /&gt;\r\n99.9% Uptime&lt;br /&gt;\r\n[Order Now $4/M](https://virmach.com/manage/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=70&amp;promocode=LETWINPRO1X) - _Save $6.00_ &lt;br /&gt;\r\nCOUPON CODE **LETWINPRO1X**\r\n\r\nDiscount is applied at final page of checkout.
