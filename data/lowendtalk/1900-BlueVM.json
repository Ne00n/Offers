So we've decided to offer a one time limited offer to only LET/LEB... a $10 annual or $5.50 semi-annual VPS package:\r\n\r\n64 MB of Guaranteed RAM\r\n128 MB Burstable\r\n1 CPU Core (@1.8 GHz + (on 2.5 GHz+ cores))\r\n5 GB of Storage\r\n150 GB of Bandwidth\r\n1 IP Address\r\n\r\nSecure Order URL: https://www.bluevm.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=52\r\n\r\nLocation: Continuum Datacenter in Nevada\r\nPing IP: 205.134.228.126\r\n\r\nQuick note: These plans aren't customizable or upgradable to any of our other plans. (AKA once you have it, you can't change up to a larger plan and get a discount, you have to order the larger plan). These plans aren't upgradable because of their limited slots/sale time and the limited availability of the server we're placing them on. Once we're out we aren't going to restock. This sale is for LEB/LET only for the first 24 hours, after that we'll post it on a few other forums."}
