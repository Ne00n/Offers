I found out URPad doesn't do refunds :)\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, here's the deal: I have a URPad VPS I bought on an impulse, but am realizing now I really didn't need. So, I'd like to sell it off to someone here. The specs are as follows:\r\n\r\n40 GB Hard Drive\r\n768 MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n1024 MB Burstable RAM\r\n750 GB Bandwidth\r\n100Mbps Port\r\n1 IP Address\r\nOpenVZ\r\nLocated in Chicaco (test IP: 198.144.179.130)\r\nCurrently has Ubuntu 12.04 on it, but of course you can reinstall it.\r\n\r\nThis is the $19/yr [\"2K13JAN768MB\"](https://billing.urpad.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=233) plan. I've had it for 10 days and done nothing with it, and you can get it now for **$15 for the year** (until February 11, 2014). There is, I'm sure, no better price/spec ratio currently available right now. I've talked with URPad, and they'll do the transfer. If you're interested, PM me."}
