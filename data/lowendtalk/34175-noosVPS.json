Check out our exciting plans listed below!\r\n\r\nOur Features\r\n----\r\n**KVM VPS only**  \r\nWe offer KVM VPS only. Focusing in a single technology ensures that we are able to deliver quality KVM virtualization solutions for everyone.\r\n\r\n**No overselling of resources**  \r\nWe do not over-sell. Never. New orders are refunded if all available resources are in maximum use, but in no case are they hosted on a saturated node.\r\n\r\n**Superior hardware and network**  \r\nOur servers are powered by Dual Intel Xeon L5520 processors with 36-72GB RAM. HDD is on RAID 1, with additional SSD storages included as per requirement. Hosted in a very reputed green datacenter at NC, US with gigabit network connectivity.\r\n\r\n**OpenNebula Control Panel**  \r\nOpenNebula Sunstone is our VPS control panel. The decision to move away from paid control panels like SolusVM reduce our overall costs due to which we can afford to provide KVM VPS at cheap rates than others.
