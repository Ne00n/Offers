Our aim is to provide affordable and high performance virtual servers. We've come up with two exclusive offers for LET/LEB.\r\n\r\nWe've set a large focus on DDoS-Protection and that's the reason why we chose OVH Roubaix as our first location. Our nodes have their Anti-DDoS Pro service enabled, wich has some extra features over the normal service, one being permanent mitigation. This means that our servers are perfect for customers running services at risk of attacks (Ex. Game or Voice Servers).\r\n\r\n**OpenVZ - 1024MB:**\r\n\r\n   * 1024MB RAM\r\n   * 2 CPU Cores\r\n   * 100GB HDD Storage\r\n   * 1Gbps Connection\r\n   * 2TB Bandwidth\r\n   * Instant Setup!\r\n   * Coupon Code: 1024LEB\r\n   * \u20ac3.95/mo (Normally \u20ac6)\r\n   *  [Order Here](https://vikinglayer.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2)\r\n\r\n**OpenVZ - 2048MB:**\r\n\r\n   * 2048MB RAM\r\n   * 4 CPU Cores\r\n   * 125GB HDD Storage\r\n   * 1Gbps Connection\r\n   * 3TB Bandwidth\r\n   * Instant Setup!\r\n   * Coupon Code: 2048LEB\r\n   * \u20ac5.45/mo (Normally \u20ac12)\r\n   *  [Order Here](https://vikinglayer.com/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3)\r\n \r\n**Network Information**  \r\nOVH - Roubaix, France  \r\nTest IPv4: 5.196.116.1  \r\nTest IPv6: 2001:41d0:2:e0bc::1:1337  \r\nDownload Test: http://188.165.12.106/files/1Gb.dat\r\n\r\n**Node Specifications:**\r\n\r\n   * Intel Xeon E5-1600 Series CPU (3.6Ghz+)\r\n   * 64GB RAM\r\n   * 3x2TB HDD\r\n\r\n**General Information**\r\n\r\n   * Based in Sweden\r\n   * PayPal and BitPay Business Verified\r\n\r\n**TOS/AUP (Short Version)**  \r\nIf your VPS is found to be degrading the performance of other VPSs, you will be notified via ticket and asked to reduce your usage.
