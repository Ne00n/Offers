OpenVZ based, E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40 GHz, 1 GB RAM (+512 MB vswap), 10 GB HDD (~100 MB/s), 500 GB bandwidth (wget gave 37.8M/s from 100 MB cachefly testfile). It will be created for the winner for a whole month. Note there's no control panel like Solus, you'll choose the system you'd like to get (32/64 debian, centos, ubuntu - standard or minimal are available) and root access and that's all. Please note that I'm able to accept Bitcoins only, so keep it on your mind before bidding! :)\r\n  \r\n  Start price: $0.1 (and let's say it's a value of minimal bid also)\r\n  \r\n  Auction will end on Monday, 10 August 2015, 11:00:00 (London time). Here's the [countdown](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150810T11&amp;p0=136&amp;msg=VPS+auction&amp;font=cursive).\r\n  \r\n Calling @AnthonySmith to approve the auction rules! :)"}
