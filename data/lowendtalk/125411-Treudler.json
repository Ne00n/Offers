What type of virtualization do you use? For VPS-* we use OpenVZ meanwhile for KVM-* and vDEDI-* we use KVM. \r\n\r\nQ. Are my resources dedicated? Yes, your resources are fully dedicated to you, that means you can use them fully at any time. Otherwise we apply a fair-use policy to CPUs (if you need to use 100% of your CPU H24/7, you can simply buy a vDEDI where CPUs are fully DEDICATED).\r\n\r\nQ. Are your services monitored? Yes, all our systems are monitored by our technical engineers all the day and alerts are setuped to ring when an issue is detected.\r\n\r\nQ. Is the traffic really unmetered? Yes, we love (legit) traffic leaving or entering our network. Of course nothing illegal (refer to our Terms of Service for more about that) is permitted but DMCA is ignored here. Traffic limits are applied only to our APAC plans and terms are specified in the product description.\r\n\r\nQ. What are the available payment gateways? Actually you can pay with PayPal (fast and secure), bank transfer, CoinGate (BTC/Altcoins) or PaySafeCard. If you choose to pay by bank transfer or PSC, delivery time may be delayed. Meanwhile, if you use PayPal as your gateway, your VPS will be delivered in a few minutes (in normal conditions). \r\n\r\nQ. Do you allow torrenting? No, torrents or any other application that may lead to our node stability are highly forbidden.\r\n\r\n###Useful links\r\nWebsite: https://www.treudler.net/\r\nStatus page: https://www.treudler-status.net/\r\nLegal disclosure: https://www.treudler.net/legal\r\nTerms of Service: https://www.treudler.net/terms-of-service\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.treudler.net/web/logo/virtualizor-noc.png)\r\n\r\n*If you have any other question, just leave us a PM here or send an email to support@treudler.net!
