That means we didn\u2019t cut any corners when building out our infrastructure, we rigorously tested and designed our Windows VPS IaaS offering exclusively with AMD Ryzen 3900X processors, featuring DDR4 RAM and enterprise-grade Intel NVMe drives. The performance of each Windows VPS is stunning.\r\n\r\nPerformance was a heavy emphasis when designing our new Windows VPS platform. When it comes to Windows VPS, we understand that consumers simply want an experience that is rapid, responsive, and highly available. As an illustrative example - in a soft-launch we ran, we\u2019ve even had some users tell us that their Ryzen-powered Windows VPS with us with just 1 core outperforms their Windows VPS with another host that had 4 Intel Xeon Cores! This is thanks to our platform leveraging the unmatched performance of AMD Ryzen and Enterprise Intel NVMe SSD drives.\r\n\r\nWe are available several different ways to assist you:\r\n\r\n**EMAIL US:** sales@racknerd.com\r\n**CALL US:** 1 (888) 881-NERD\r\n**CHAT WITH US:** https://racknerd.com/\r\n\r\nWe are not just experienced in what we do, but we are a steadily growing web-hosting company that will not only meet but exceed your expectations.
