SmartHost Virtual Private Server packages allow you to select custom resources for cpu, memory, diskspace, and bandwidth allotments, which you can then utilize for any number of websites, and/or in any method that you desire. SmartHost Virtual Private Servers are designed for the client who would like to have the highest quality and reliability in server hardware, with the software and operational features of a Dedicated Server---all at a price closer to that of Shared Hosting.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\n**ULTRA-FAST SPEEDS from within one of our NVME SSD WINDOWS VPS:** \r\nCrystalDiskMark shows sequential read/write speeds of 1850 MB/s !!!\r\n\r\n**ULTRA-FAST SPEEDS from within one of our NVME SSD LINUX VPS:** \r\n[root@nvme ~]# dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/tempfile bs=64k count=16k conv=fdatasync\r\n1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 1.08874 s, 986 MB/s !!!\r\n[root@nvme ~]# dd if=/root/tempfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024\r\n1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 0.130273 s, 8.2 GB/s !!!\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;ins&gt;**KVM NVME SSD Windows VPS**&lt;/ins&gt; - [DETAILS](https://www.smarthost.net/vps-hosting.php?ims=letvps)\r\n20GB NVME SSD Disk Space\r\n1GB RAM\r\n1000GB Bandwidth\r\nSolusVM Control Panel\r\nFully Customizable Resources\r\nWindows 2019, 2016, 2012, or 2008\r\n[ORDER NOW](https://www.smarthost.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=173&amp;ims=letvps)  - Starting at $7.95/monthly\r\n**LET PROMO CODE: LET7WIN** - $1.00 OFF = $6.95/monthly\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;ins&gt;**KVM NVME SSD Linux VPS**&lt;/ins&gt; - [DETAILS](https://www.smarthost.net/vps-hosting.php?ims=letvps)\r\n10GB NVME SSD Disk Space\r\n1GB RAM\r\n1000GB Bandwidth\r\nSolusVM Control Panel\r\nFully Customizable Resources\r\nCentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Fedora, &amp; more...\r\n[ORDER NOW](https://www.smarthost.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=171&amp;ims=letvps) - Starting at $2.95/monthly\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\n**SERVICE LOCATIONS**: Los Angeles CA, Las Vegas NV, Dallas TX, Jacksonville FL, Herndon VA, Denver CO, Buffalo NY, &amp; Piscataway NJ. - [DATA CENTER DETAILS](https://www.smarthost.net/data-centers.php?ims=letvps)\r\n\r\n**Coming Soon**: London UK, Amsterdam NL, Seattle WA, Chicago IL, &amp; Boston MA. \r\nNOTE: OpenVZ/Xen already in some of this markets awaiting KVM NVME rollout.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\nSmartHost Virtual Private Servers give you the perfect opportunity to operate as a Dedicated Server with root access---to learn the operations of such without risk, and without the huge outlay of capital.
