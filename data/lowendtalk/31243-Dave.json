After years of testing and refinement, we've created the Holy Grail of VPS. DireVPS are proud to present our new **GLUTEN FREE** range!\r\n\r\nRaised on a Highland farm, near the windy shores of OpenITC Vale, just east of Sea Peue, we've crafted the finest VPS, capturing both flavour and performance that's coeliac compatible.\r\n\r\nIf you're experiencing bloating, diarrhoea, nausea, wind, constipation, tiredness, headaches, mouth ulcers, sudden or unexpected weight loss when using other VPS then you could benefit from using ours!\r\n\r\nWe guarantee our products to be GLUTEN FREE!*\r\n\r\nTake one VPS every month for several months. This is unlikely to reduce your symptoms but will definitely not worsen your gluten allergy.\r\n\r\n*Made on a server which has been near nuts. Whilst every effort has been made during the preparation of your VPS, some bones may still be present and could represent a choking hazard. Please consult a doctor before using if pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Our Range of Treatments**\r\n\r\n**KVM**\r\n\r\n_KVM VPS Option #1: \u00a32.50/month (~$4.17USD)_&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2 vCPU Cores&lt;br /&gt;\r\n512MB RAM&lt;br /&gt;\r\n25GB Disk&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2.5TB Monthly transfer&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2 x /64 IPv6 subnets&lt;br /&gt;\r\nGigabit connection&lt;br /&gt;\r\n12.5GB FREE FTP BACKUP SPACE Order URL&lt;br /&gt;\r\nhttps://clients.openitc.co.uk/order/type/20\r\n\r\n_KVM VPS Option #2: \u00a34.00/month (~$6.67USD)_&lt;br /&gt;\r\n4 vCPU Cores&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1GB RAM&lt;br /&gt;\r\n50GB Disk&lt;br /&gt;\r\n5TB Monthly transfer&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2 x /64 IPv6 subnets&lt;br /&gt;\r\nGigabit connection&lt;br /&gt;\r\n25GB FREE FTP BACKUP SPACE Order URL&lt;br /&gt;\r\nhttps://clients.openitc.co.uk/order/type/20\r\n\r\n**OS's Available**\r\nYou can self-install any OS that's on a Chunk Encoding enabled HTTP server which is accessible from our servers.
