Exchanges include AMS-IX and BIX Budapest.\r\n\r\nWe have native IPv6 support! All virtual machines include a /64 IPv6 subnet free of charge. \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;DDoS protection details:&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nWe have the capacity to mitigate attacks up to 80Gbps. Please do note that the guaranteed protection capacity is ~20Gbps. Attacks over the size are mitigated on a best effort basis. \r\n\r\nWe can protect from all common forms on Layer 3 and 4. These could include UDP, spoofed forms (such as NTP, CHARGEN, SSDP etc), ICMP, SYN and various TCP types.\r\n\r\nIf an incoming attack exceeds the capacity available at a certain period, your /32 may be nullrouted automatically. Your IP will automatically be released within 20 minutes, unless the attack is still ongoing. Many factors account for the available capacity, depending on the source of the attack and the intensity. \r\n\r\nIn example - If most of the attack is directed a single upstream, then the IP may be nullrouted at that particular upstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Payment methods:&lt;/b&gt;\r\nWe accept PayPal, Bitcoin and credit or debit cards via 2CheckOut.\r\n![](http://az767366.vo.msecnd.net/6RVQnVd.gif)\r\n![](http://az767366.vo.msecnd.net/vXKRsbU.png)\r\n![](http://az767366.vo.msecnd.net/cPATZeY.png)\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Looking glass:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nURL: http://lg-hu.xhostfire.com&lt;br&gt;\r\n100MB test speed on LG. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
