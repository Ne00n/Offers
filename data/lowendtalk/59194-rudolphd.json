Everything was great for 20 days (100Mbps UP/DOWN), but then it suddenly got very slow. They reinstalled the whole VPS and speed increased from 6 Mbps UP to 13 Mbps.\r\n\r\nSo, can anyone offer a VPS with **~200 GB** disk space, **unlimited bandwidth**, **Windows**, **at least 1.5 GB ram** for $8 - 15 monthly"}
