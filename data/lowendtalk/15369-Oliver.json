With new equipment at Equinix in Sydney on the Servers Australia network ([http://bgp.he.net/AS45671](http://bgp.he.net/AS45671)) Ransom IT can offer improved latency into most foreign locations (especially Asia) and significantly higher bandwidth limits and port speeds for all customers. You can test your latency to this location with this IP: 103.25.58.1\r\n\r\nThere's a range of new plans available here immediately: https://www.ransomit.com.au/vps#sydney_kvm\r\n\r\nFor a limited time I will offer the base 'Rams Head' plan at LEB appropriate pricing of $21 per quarter. You need to choose the quarterly billing option to be able to use the promo code which is **DOUBLEMYNET** and you can pay in USD or AUD or Euros.\r\n\r\nOrder here: [https://secure.ransomit.com.au/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=80&amp;carttpl=cart](https://secure.ransomit.com.au/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=80&amp;carttpl=cart)\r\n\r\nSince I know the LEB audience loves lots of data and fast port speeds the promo code will not only reduce the price to $21 quarterly but will also double the bandwidth limit and the port speed so you will get:\r\n\r\n- KVM VPS/Solus\r\n- 512MB RAM\r\n- 10GB Disk Space (RAID10 HDDs)\r\n- 1 CPU core (E5-1410)\r\n- **200GB of data on a 200mbit port** (in and out counted equally)\r\n- 1 IPv4, 10 IPv6"}
