It's just one of those things that always happen at night. On this occasion, a stormy, rainy night, with no-one around and the air heavy with anticipation.\r\n\r\nHow odd. I couldn't find the light switch and the feeling of something not right, something unusual began to play on my mind as lightning threw strange shadows across the walls. I sensed I wasn't alone.\r\n\r\nI walked up to the last cabinet and by chance, lightening coursed through the sky once more, lighting up a clown mannequin, sending adrenaline through my veins. It felt like a thousand hot needles had seared their way through my arms and legs and put me on high alert.\r\n\r\nShaken to the core, I finally made the call:\r\n\r\n\"Hi Sean, I'm just swapping these drives out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh great. We need those online asap. How's it going?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's fine - I'm just at the cabinet now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make sure you get the right one haha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just at the cabinet on the left, opposite the clown.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Sean's voice trails off, the laughter draining away to silence.\r\n\r\n\"Get out of there right now...\"\r\n\r\nPanicked, I asked \"Why? What's wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've gone into the clothing warehouse next door again you clod.\"\r\n\r\nHappy Halloween!\r\n\r\n\r\n**KVM**\r\n\r\nKVM VPS Option #1: \u00a32.50/month (~$4.17USD)\u2028&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2 vCPU Cores&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u2028512MB RAM&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u202825GB Disk\u2028&lt;br /&gt;\r\n2.5TB Monthly transfer\u2028&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u20282 x /64 IPv6 subnets&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u2028Gigabit connection&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u202812.5GB FREE FTP BACKUP SPACE&lt;br /&gt;\r\n**Order URL\u2028** https://clients.openitc.co.uk/order/type/20\r\n\r\nKVM VPS Option #2: \u00a34.00/month (~$6.67USD)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u20284 vCPU Cores\u2028&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1GB RAM\u2028&lt;br /&gt;\r\n50GB Disk\u2028&lt;br /&gt;\r\n5TB Monthly transfer&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u20281 IPv4 Address\u20282 x /64 IPv6 subnets&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u2028Gigabit connection\u2028&lt;br /&gt;\r\n25GB FREE FTP BACKUP SPACE&lt;br /&gt;\r\n**Order URL** \u2028https://clients.openitc.co.uk/order/type/20\r\n\r\n\r\n**OS's Available**\r\n\r\nYou can self-install any OS that's on a Chunk Encoding enabled HTTP server which is accessible from our servers.
