We have designed a platform that makes it easy to buy servers for cheap and upgrade them as needed.  Cloud3K maintains servers in **four datacenters** across the USA.\r\n\r\nRockMyWeb is celebrating our six year anniversary and offering incredible discounts on our already low-priced cloud servers.\r\n\r\n**What are cloud servers?\r\n============================================================**\r\n\r\nOur cloud servers run VPSGrid, a custom platform for Virtuozzo-based systems.  From your end, you will not notice a difference except for better uptime and performance.  On the backend, however, VPSGrid does the following:\r\n1. Creates a live backup of your server ensuring data will not be lost in the event of hardware failures.\r\n2. Monitors servers for downtime and uses the live backup in case of failure, protecting your server from long periods of downtime.\r\n3. Balances load between physical servers making sure you have the available CPU and RAM your server demands!\r\n\r\n**Upgrades\r\n============================================================**\r\n\r\nFirst you must order a package, below, to create your virtual server.  Then you can instantly add or remove upgrades using our control panel.  Upgrades are charged daily but prorated hourly so you only pay for what you need at the time.  If you expect lots of traffic, you can go to the control panel and instantly boost your server.\r\n\r\nRAM/CPU Upgrade: 512MB RAM + 500MHz Guaranteed CPU\r\n$3.50/month (11.7 cents per day)\r\n\r\nDisk Upgrade: 25GB Disk + 30 IOPS\r\n$3.50/month (11.7 cents per day)\r\n\r\n**Base Packages\r\n============================================================**\r\n\r\nWe offer two base packages.  Our Private Cloud Server is our low end box service starting at just $5.95 with our special!  If you need more, you can always upgrade to our vDedicated package or add RAM or Disk space on the fly through our control panel.\r\n\r\nPrivate Cloud Server\r\n1GB RAM\r\n50GB Disk Space\r\n4-CPUs Burstable\r\n$7.95 / mo  ($5.95 with SIXYEAR coupon)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe offer packages in our four datacenters including the Chicago, New York, and Las Vegas areas.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cloud3k.com/servers.php\r\n\r\n**Special\r\n============================================================**\r\n\r\nUsing the SIXYEAR coupon on the order form will save you $2.00/month on any of our packages on www.cloud3k.com\r\n\r\n**High Performance\r\n============================================================**\r\n\r\nDedicated CPU:  We give more dedicated and burstable CPU than any provider with similar pricing.\r\n\r\nSSD Powered: Our servers use a RAID10 cached with SSD for high performance reads and writes.  Our servers are geared to handle 1000s of IOPS as compared to a single hard drive which can only handle 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit us today at www.cloud3k.com, use our contact form for more information if you have questions."}
