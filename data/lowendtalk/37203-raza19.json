Giving it away only because I own multiple plans from crissic.\r\n\r\n&gt;50GB HD\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;512MB Ram\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;2TB BW\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;2 ipv4\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;FL,USA\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;$15 annual renewal\r\n&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is basically the old plan with 2 ipv4s and from what I understand it has been discontinued because of the increasing ipv4 costs.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants it, please PM me asap, otherwise I would have to cancel the service since it renews tomorrow. Kindly note that you will have to renew after the vps is migrated to your account."}
