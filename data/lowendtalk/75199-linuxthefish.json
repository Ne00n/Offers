We use AS200039, with DDoS protection through Voxility up to and over 100Gbps. Always on protection and layer 7 protection can be turned on/off by request, but we cannot add custom filters. No SLA guarantee on these offers, but if a node goes down due to an unplanned or unexplained event all VPS's affected get a free month of service :)\r\n\r\nAs this is a DDoS protected offer, there will be times that attacks will filter through and cause packet loss. This offer is not suitable for running anything that requires a permanent connection such as IRC, due to the shared nature of the DDoS protection. Thank you for your understanding! If you are looking for a VPS on better hardware and with higher capacity ddos protection, check out @Zare directly.\r\n\r\nIf this offer does not work out, you will be migrated to an alternate datacenter in the UK while keeping the same IP or a refund given.\r\n\r\n**Extra IP's are $12 a year with justification - [Read TOS before ordering](https://dedistation.com/TOS.html) (No virtual currency, Tor or Hitleap without asking)**\r\n\r\n&gt; [LET UK OpenVZ 1 - $15 Yearly - Click here to sign up](https://dedistation.com/billing/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=4&amp;product=15)\r\n&gt; ===============\r\n&gt; * **1**GB DDR3 RAM   \r\n&gt; * **15**GB Disk Space   \r\n&gt; * **1** CPU Core   \r\n&gt; * **1**TB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps   \r\n&gt; * **100+**Gbps, Layer 4 DDoS Protection   \r\n&gt; * **1** IPv4 Address   \r\n&gt; * **UK** Datacenter   \r\n&gt; * SolusVM Control Panel   \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; [LET UK OpenVZ 2 - $7.50 Quarterly - Click here to sign up](https://dedistation.com/billing/order.php?step=1&amp;productGroup=4&amp;product=16)\r\n&gt; ===============\r\n&gt; * **2**GB DDR3 RAM  \r\n&gt; * **30**GB Disk Space   \r\n&gt; * **2** CPU Core   \r\n&gt; * **2**TB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps   \r\n&gt; * **100+**Gbps, Layer 4 DDoS Protection   \r\n&gt; * **1** IPv4 Address   \r\n&gt; * **UK** Datacenter   \r\n&gt; * SolusVM Control Panel   \r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read through this, and yes I know this is single homed with a 10Gbps link to London."}
