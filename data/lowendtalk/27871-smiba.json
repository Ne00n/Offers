You may wonder why would i buy it then? To save you from the \u20ac1100 ASA setup costs. &lt;br /&gt;Thats why selling it for \u20ac500 seems fair to me. (Reply if you want to make a lower offer trough)\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;256GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;2x E5-2670v2&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;500Mbit (1Gbit burst)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;+ LSI 9271-4i Hardware raid (2x 600GB 15K SAS &amp; 80GB SSD cache)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;+ Cisco ASA5520&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nThe whole bunch costs ~\u20ac680/Month (Taxes included) and will be about \u20ac660/Month in 4 months."}
