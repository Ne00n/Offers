Defined Code Ltd is a small company based in the Midlands, United Kingdom. We own all our hardware and have personally visited and installed it in the datacenter we colocate at in Rotterdam, Netherlands (Netrouting).\r\n\r\n**Datacenter information:** Netrouting is housed in an ex-HP building meaning it has top security. It's a carrier neutral datacenter in Rotterdam with over 11000 sqft of datacenter space, there is 240gbps+ of external network capacity.\r\n\r\n**Hardware:** We currently use HP hardware with the latest Intel Xeon E3 CPUs (v3). You should not expect these \"Mini\" VPSs to outperform a full SSD node, however we try our hardest to deliver a quality you will enjoy for the price.\r\n\r\n**About our NAT IPv4 VPSs:** These \"Mini\" servers do not come with a dedicated IPv4 address, instead they share an IPv4 address and you are assigned 21 ports on it. 1 port for SSH and the rest for whatever you want (VPNs, web servers, you name it!). This means that when you host a website you will have to append a port to the end, these are randomly generated and you can view yours in your control panel.\r\n\r\n**Good news IPv6 support is now available. We can allocate you a /64 via a tunnel to HE. We will have native IPv6 in the coming future but for now this works with these results to google.com `rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 11.211/11.332/11.467/0.165 ms`. After you purchase a VPS with us, please PM and we can manually allocate a /64. These are on a first-come-first-served bases.**\r\n\r\n**July offers with coupon code INTROLEBT:**\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Mini 64**\r\n&gt; RAM: 64MB  \r\n&gt; Unmanaged  \r\n&gt; 3GB RAID HDD  \r\n&gt; 50GB Transfer (in/out)  \r\n&gt; 1GBIT uplink  \r\n&gt; 20 IPv4 NAT Ports  \r\n&gt; 1 IPv4 NAT SSH Port  \r\n&gt; OpenVZ Virtualisation  \r\n&gt; Price: \u00a32/year with coupon code: INTROLEBT  \r\n&gt; Order: [https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1](https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1)  \r\n\r\n**Mini 128**\r\n&gt; RAM: 128MB  \r\n&gt; Unmanaged  \r\n&gt; 3GB RAID HDD  \r\n&gt; 50GB Transfer (in/out)  \r\n&gt; 1GBIT uplink  \r\n&gt; 20 IPv4 NAT Ports  \r\n&gt; 1 IPv4 NAT SSH Port  \r\n&gt; OpenVZ Virtualisation  \r\n&gt; Price: \u00a34/year with coupon code: INTROLEBT  \r\n&gt; Order: [https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2](https://definedcodehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2)  \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Payments:** All payments are taken via Stripe.  \r\n\r\n**Test IP:** 94.228.216.114  \r\n**Test file:** [https://definedcodehosting.com/10mb.bin](https://definedcodehosting.com/10mb.bin)\r\n\r\n**Simple AUP/TOS:** TOR, Torrents, Bitcoin (and associated altcoins (Litecoin etc)), Minecraft, Public Proxies and Public VPN software are all prohibited.
