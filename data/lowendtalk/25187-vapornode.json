More details are below. I have already confirmed with the company behind the software that license transfers are allowed, free of charge, even though information about a transfer is lacking in the license agreement.\r\n \r\n\r\nLicense type: owned, branded\r\n\r\n\r\nBranding removal price: $89.95 one time fee\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluded in price: standard owned license, SMTP addon, GeoIP addon, WinApp addon\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal purchase date: October 27, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal license price: $149.95\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the license was first purchased, 1 year of support and updates were included. That year has passed however I have never needed to contact tech support and I can confirm that you are still able to download the most recent version of the software. There isn't even a place to extend the support/update period so I can only assume that clause has changed.\r\n \r\n\r\nTwo other points: the license is valid on multiple domains and the software package is open source. You are free to modify the code for your own use and use the same license on multiple domains as long as the domains are owned by the same business/individual.\r\n \r\n\r\n**I am looking to get at least $100 for the license as it is multi-domain, open source, and stable.** We have been using the software for the full 2 years the license has been active and have never encountered any major issues. That said, **price is negotiable. Payments via PayPal only.**\r\n \r\nIf you decide to purchase this, be prepared to give a valid company name, name, email, phone, and website URL to update the profile information for the account."}
