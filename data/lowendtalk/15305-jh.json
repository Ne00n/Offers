Our off-the-shelf services are our apps, which together with our unique and customisable dashboard (coming soon), form your Loading Deck.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;What's Included&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nLoading Deck is pleased to (finally) launch its billing, project and inventory management app as software-as-a-service (i.e. we host it, take care of security, backups etc.) This early release comprises the below key features making it ideal for freelancers and tiny SMEs. \r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Simple, beautiful point-and-click PDF invoices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Proforma invoice support&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Included support for automatic payment collection with Paypal Standard&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Support for 53 PCI gateways without having to go through your own PCI compliance (via Spreedly.com)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Recurring billing with reminders and overdue notices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Project management with attachments, tasks and time tracking&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Inventory tracking with easy simple/bulk management including serial numbers&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Bulk data import+export to/from CSV&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Server-side data sorting, searching and filtering&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nAdditionally, development is ongoing with the following features just around the corner (some of these are mostly already implemented but removed for this release to support stability):\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Brand new mobile-friendly UI with a jQuery customisable dashboard&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Event triggers to facilitate better business automation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Products, product groups and order pages&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;RESTful API&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Staff permissions&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Additional FREE payment gateways including 2Checkout and GoCardless&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to store credit cards against customers for flexible future billing&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Multi-currency support backed by XE.com conversions to a base currency&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Screenshots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAvailable here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/105147395@N04/10350619194/in/set-72157636696965706/lightbox/\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\u00a310/agent/month&lt;br /&gt;\r\nOptionally: + \u00a310/month for use of a PCI gateway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nUnlike some other services, there are no limits on the number of clients you can have, invoices you can send etc.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://control.loadingdeck.com/sign-up\"&gt;Signup Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Quick Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nPlease remember that this is an early release, to help steer development.
