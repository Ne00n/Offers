This year's IOFLOOD Black Friday sale offers the most powerful CPUs we've offered, at our lowest prices ever.\r\n\r\nWe expect these will sell out quickly, so wanted to make sure that Low End Talk users got the opportunity to save the most money with us. Because of that, you can buy these configurations right away!\r\n\r\nYour three powerful, ready-to-go server options are as follows:\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n***First, the ultimate beast server:***\r\n\r\n* Dual 10-Core Xeon E5-2680v2 CPUs (20 total cores, 40 total threads)\r\n* 64GBRAM\r\n* 800GB Intel DC S3510 Enterprise SSD\r\n* 10tb / mo b/w on 1gbps port\r\n* /29 IPv4 allocation (5 usable IPs)\r\n\r\nAll just ***$84 / mo!***\r\n(List price on this server is over $400 / mo!)\r\n\r\nGet your server here: https://manage.ioflood.com/order/?form_id=197\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n***Next, a top performer at an entry-level price:***\r\n\r\n* Dual 8-Core Xeon E5-2660v1 CPUs\r\n* 32GB Ram\r\n* 400GB Intel DC S3700 Enterprise SSD\r\n* 10tb / mo b/w on 1gbps port\r\n* /29 IPv4 allocation (5 usable IPs)\r\n\r\nYou only pay ***$69 / mo!***\r\n\r\nGet your server here: https://manage.ioflood.com/order/?form_id=188\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n***Finally, if you require performance, storage, and redundancy:***\r\n\r\n* Dual 8-Core Xeon E5-2660v1 CPUs\r\n* 32GB Ram\r\n* 2x 3TB HDD\r\n* 10tb / mo b/w on 1gbps port\r\n* /29 IPv4 allocation (5 usable IPs)\r\n\r\nOnly pay ***$69 / mo!***\r\n\r\nGet your server here: https://manage.ioflood.com/order/?form_id=199\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese prices are good for as long as you have the server.\r\n\r\nOur stock is very limited, so if you do not act fast it may be too late!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***What are customers like you saying about I/O FLOOD?***\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***Our feedback speaks for itself:***\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1157469\r\n\r\n&gt; Support is outstanding with Gabe, hes very friendly and has even helped me with things which are way outside of the providers support realm and I should have been charged for the additional support...We have expanded to around 19 services with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?p=8740724\r\n\r\n&gt; Their services are excellent, and raise the bar of what I've come to expect from unmanaged dedicated server providers. I upgraded hardware once, adding a SSD for performance reasons. The upgrade went very smoothly, Gabriel asked me when we should start, gave an estimate how long it'd take from then on, and how exactly the update would take place, and - well, that's exactly how it happened. No problems at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://mlpforums.com/topic/21625-welcome-to-the-new-server/\r\n\r\n&gt; The company behind this awesome new server is I/O Flood. I want to take the time to give a special thanks to Gabe, who has been extremely helpful over the past couple of weeks in getting everything set up and ready to go for us in tip-top shape, offered me an amazing deal, and has gone above and beyond the level of service you'd normally expect from a hosting company.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1037123\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7197659&amp;postcount=8\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1063124\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?p=7327776\r\n\r\nhttp://mlpforums.com/topic/21625-welcome-to-the-new-server/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7259254&amp;postcount=19\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1037123\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1029536\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?p=7221370\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7215169&amp;postcount=36\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7211725&amp;postcount=29\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7211659&amp;postcount=15\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\n***Why Choose I/O Flood?***\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nI/O FLOOD exists to help entrepreneurs start and grow successful small businesses.
