I wanted to take a minute to introduce MXroute to those of you who may not have heard of us. We provide e-mail hosting for your domains at a fraction of the cost of most mail services, while providing above average uptime and fast mail servers. I also wanted to announce that as of today MXroute has expanded to New York City, where all new accounts will be provisioned for the moment. We are excited to expand our services to a second reputable provider here at LET, @INIZ.\r\n\r\nAs of today we also have an unbranded server available for resellers. This is available on the monthly plans. The order links for this can be found below.\r\n\r\nI would like to offer once again as I have in the past, the two following promo codes for MXroute's services.\r\n\r\nPromo Code: TRYMX&lt;br&gt;\r\n20% off, non-recurring discount.\r\n\r\nPromo Code: MX10&lt;br&gt;\r\n10% off, recurring discount.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Z-Push&lt;br&gt;\r\nActiveSync compatible push services for your devices.
