If none of these payment methods is applicable to you, you might also pay via SEPA wire transfer, but you will need to open a ticket for that.\r\n\r\n*We know your credit card information is very sensitive and thus we will never store your credit card details on our servers. Instead, those are handled by the payment processor Stripe and we only store a token and the last four digits for later reference.\r\n\r\n**How long until my virtual server is ready to use?**\r\nProvisioning of new virtual servers is fully automated and takes about 5 minutes. As soon as we receive your payment, the setup process is automatically launched for the operating system you selected in the checkout form. (Provided that our system didn't flag you as potential fraud.)\r\n\r\n**What kinds of usages are accepted?**\r\nWe accept almost every form of usage that does not make excessive use of our hardware and network, and is not consider illegal in Austria or the Netherlands. In addition, public VPNs, Tor nodes and anything Torrent related is forbidden. For a more detailed list, see the \u201cAccepted Usage Policy\u201d section of our [Terms of Service](https://www.alwyzon.com/terms).\r\n\r\n**Which operating systems are supported?**\r\nWe can provide you with the latest CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSuse and Ubuntu releases pre-installed on your virtual server; or you can upload any ISO and install whatever operating system you would like to use.\r\n\r\n**What level of support is provided?**\r\nThese are unmanaged virtual server offers, so you are expected to install and configure the server yourself. We give you root access to the virtual server, but you will have to setup any software according to your requirements.\r\n\r\n**Are those discounts recurring?**\r\nYes, they are! And since you were reading all that text, let me give you one more treat: the first user that post a small review below this post get a 5\u20ac voucher for their next purchase or service renewal.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n_Alwyzon is a trading name of Hohl IT e.U.,  a company registered at the court of Graz (Austria), company number 538746z.
