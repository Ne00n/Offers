It has all the basic features (HTTP check, content check, ping check, email/SMS notifications, latency graphs), it costs $1.25/month for the normal plan, and it sends out actual SMS messages (no cheap email-to-SMS gateways) so you can set a special text tone for when your site's down and you need to wake up\u2014stat!\r\n\r\nI really like (and use) other monitoring services for certain sites, and would definitely recommend something like [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/) or one of the 'big names' for complex monitoring scenarios, but these services are often cumbersome and expensive. Thus, Server Check.in.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it\u2014[sign up](https://servercheck.in/user/register) with the coupon code **LET13INTRO** to get 20% off (that's $1/month for the first year!). Coupon expires on 8/30/13.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think of the service, and what I could do to make it better for you."}
