Over the recent weeks that we have been on LET/LEB we have gotten some great feedback and reviews from our clients, and so far no complaints, other than a few minor issues. SwiftVM is being run by two enthusiastic friends who have been working with systems, and worked for a few other hosts the last years. We have a high standard for our performance and therefor only use Samsung SSD's, providing us with I/O speeds of over 1GB/s.\r\n\r\n**Hardware &amp; Network**\r\nSupermicro Rack Servers\r\nIntel Xeon E3-1270v2\r\n32GB ECC DDR3 RAM\r\nSamsung 840PRO 512GB SSD's RAID10\r\n100Mbits from node to switch\r\n1Gbit from node to backup server\r\nPrivate vLAN between nodes\r\n\r\nOur servers are hosted in the AIS datacenter, located in San Diego, California.\r\nTestfiles, test IP's on our Looking Glass at ping.swiftvm.com\r\n\r\n**The Offer**\r\n256MB RAM\r\n256MB vSwap\r\n&lt;strike&gt;4GB&lt;/strike&gt; 8GB SSD Storage\r\n&lt;strike&gt;250GB&lt;/strike&gt; 500GB Premium Traffic\r\n&lt;strike&gt;$15&lt;/strike&gt; $10 /semi-annually \r\n**Order:** https://www.swiftvm.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=29\r\n\r\nYou can use the promotioncode **ALLCAPS** to receive **25% off** all other plans!\r\n_Please note that we will not apply this or any other offers to any of your existing services._\r\n\r\n**Benchmarks**\r\nhttp://serverbear.com/benchmark/2013/03/02/zh4RuSIbl8eNt6hV\r\nhttp://serverbear.com/benchmark/2013/03/02/Em8FSaCugu5PCXML\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://gyazo.com/71f97912ee2eb02ae0a5c0daa8461123.png\"&gt;\r\n\r\n**Other Stuff**\r\nWe are available over the phone, live chat and email support. We usually answer emails almost immediately, but we strive to answer emails within two hours. We are able to provide an emergency support phone number upon request.\r\n\r\nWe expect to have native **IPv6** rolling out by the end of this month, and will send out a newsletter when this is available. We will allocate as many IPv6 to your VPS as you'd like for **no additional cost**.\r\n\r\n**TOS TLDR:** Anything that is illegal in the United States is not allowed. Private VPN, legal torrents, IRC, TOR relays and Minecraft servers are allowed. Exit nodes are NOT allowed.
