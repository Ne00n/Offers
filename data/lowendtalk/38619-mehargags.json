Should I enable Keys on SSH as it is recommended? looks to be tough task. I also have Vesta's firewall and fail2ban enabled.\r\n\r\nHardening Wordpress, I need suggestions. At the moment (and previously) the whole public_html folder had read/write permissions from the \"additional FTP USER\" assigned on that domain.\r\n\r\nThese 2 sites have been running for the past 2 years very well on a non LEB VPS without a single breach, but recently I shifted them to Ramnode 4GB VPS and in under a month they are hacked to smithereens.\r\n\r\nI seek some tips and suggestions on hardening the security further. And I want to make sure that the provider's infrastructure is also not vulnerable. Please share your experiences...\r\n\r\nVery Sincerely....!\r\n"}
