All orders must pass fraud check with legit account information to be activated.\r\n\r\nDuring the beta period there will be unannounced reboots to test for disk stability, otherwise everything will remain up and active during this time.\r\n\r\nThe usual Linux distributions are available for your VPS to use during testing and you are free to do as many reloads via SolusVM as you wish.\r\n\r\nVPS Servers activated within 4-6 hours of order, maybe quicker.\r\n\r\n# Beta VPS Specs\r\n* 50GB Flashcache backed Raid10 HDD Space\r\n* 1024MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n* 1TB Gigabit Transfer\r\n* Free for 3 days\r\n* Location: Buffalo, NY\r\n\r\n[Flashcache Beta VPS Signup Link](https://cs.holoshed.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5)"}
