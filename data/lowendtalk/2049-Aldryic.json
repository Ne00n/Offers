All OVZ, and sadly no 128s (@Francisco went on a sales rampage &lt;_&lt;), but plenty of our other OVZ plans.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the posting regs, I'm only going to list the 256M and 512M plans, as the 1024 and 2048 are both above the 7$ price range.  If you'd rather one of the larger ones, feel free to hit me up via PM.\r\n\r\n**Current Availability**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n256MB OpenVZ - 3,50$/month  \r\n    256MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n    512MB Burstable RAM\r\n    30GB Disk Space (RAID10)\r\n    1000GB/month BW on Gbit\r\n    1 IPv4 &amp; 16 IPv6 with automated rDNS\r\n    Stallion Panel\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n:: _0 Available_\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n512MB OpenVZ - 5,95$/month \r\n    512MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n    1024MB Burstable RAM\r\n    50GB Disk Space (RAID10)\r\n    2000GB/month BW on Gbit\r\n    1 IPv4 &amp; 16 IPv6 with automated rDNS\r\n    Stallion Panel\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n::  _0 Available_\r\n\r\nOrders can be requested via PM to make sure I don't miss anyone.  Just let me know what email you &lt;a href=\"http://my.frantech.ca/register.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;signed up&lt;/a&gt; with, and which plan you'd like.  Annual billing is also available on all plans, and equates to ~10 months at regular cost (~2 months free).\r\n\r\nCasualties Friday ends this afternoon, around 1800h GMT-5.  I'll keep the availability count here updated throughout the day.\r\n\r\nAny LET member is welcome to request a plan;  you do not have to be a current client of ours.  As manual orders does bypass the standard methods, please be sure to read the following documentation:\r\n\r\n - &lt;a href=\"http://my.frantech.ca/tos.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;\r\n - &lt;a href=\"http://my.frantech.ca/aup.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Acceptable Usage Policy&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nAny questions, comments, concerns, bourbon donations, etc;  I'll be more than happy to handle here.  Enjoy! ^_^"}
