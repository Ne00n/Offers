So much so, that I'm going to only offer storage plans for a while. If you're interested, I've started a waiting list and will notify you when a new node is launched. I filled up a node tonight in about two hours after emailing my clients and will probably fill up one more before I notify people on the public waiting list. So keep in mind that it might be 1-2 weeks before you get an email saying there are open spots. Anyway...\r\n\r\nThe cheapest plan is detailed below:\r\n\r\n**PLAN: BKUP-1**\r\nDisk Space - 150 GB\r\nRAM - 256 MB\r\nBandwidth - 1000 GB\r\nIP Addresses - One\r\nPrice: $7.00/month\r\n\r\nTest IP: 204.152.38.84\r\nDatacenter: Wholesale Internet and Datashack (Kansas City)\r\nSupport Type: Unmanaged\r\nVPS Panel: BoxCtrl-VZ\r\nVirtualization: OpenVZ\r\n\r\nStorage plans may only be used for storing data, nothing else.
