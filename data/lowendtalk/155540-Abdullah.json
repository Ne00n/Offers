These are available in select locations for now, but will be available in all locations later on.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 CPU core (15% dedicated)\r\n512 MB RAM\r\n8 GB NVMe disk (RAID-10)\r\n1 TB premium bandwidth\r\n$15 per year \r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n[Oslo](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-05-osl), [Vienna](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-05-vie), [NY](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-05-ny), [LA](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-05-lax)\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 CPU core (30% dedicated)\r\n1 GB RAM\r\n10 GB NVMe disk (RAID-10)\r\n1 TB premium bandwidth\r\n$2.5 per month, or $30 per year\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n[Oslo](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-1-osl), [Vienna](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-1-vie), [NY](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-1-ny), [LA](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/nvme-1-lax)\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nThese are available in the following locations: Oslo, Vienna, NY and LA. Amsterdam and Stockholm will be available soon.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nWe're very liberal with CPU usage and you can use up to 100% of the core in short bursts, but we will enforce the dedicated limits if we see abuse.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the following storage plans are available in LA, Stockholm and Amsterdam. We will try and keep up with the capacity requirements to keep these in stock, however this is not a promise.\r\n(Good storage is extremely expensive to build, and harder to handle when it comes to shipping these nodes)\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 CPU core\r\n0.7 GB RAM\r\n750 GB storage\r\n2 TB premium bandwidth\r\n$35 per year\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n[LA](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-750-lax), [Amsterdam](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-750-ams), [Stockholm](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-750-sto)\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 CPU core\r\n1 GB RAM\r\n1 TB storage\r\n3 TB premium bandwidth\r\n$5.5 per month, or $50 per year\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n[LA](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-1000-lax), [Amsterdam](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-1000-ams), [Stockholm](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-1000-sto)\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 CPU core\r\n1.5 GB RAM\r\n1.5 TB storage\r\n4 TB premium bandwidth\r\n$7 per month, or $67 per year\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n[LA](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-1500-lax), [Amsterdam](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-1500-ams), [Stockholm](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-1500-sto)\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 CPU core\r\n2 GB RAM\r\n2 TB storage\r\n6 TB premium bandwidth\r\n$84 per year\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n[LA](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-2000-lax), [Amsterdam](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-2000-ams), [Stockholm](https://manage.hosthatch.com/billing/order/storage-2000-sto)\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nMultiple storage plans can be combined on request. Multiple NVMe plans cannot be combined. These plans are not suitable for seedboxes.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nAll of the above will be manually provisioned for the time being, and may take up to 24 hours. We will change this to instant setup in the future (depending on how much abuse we get from certain countries). **Limited quantities are available for each plan, and they will not be restocked soon once they are out of stock.**\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nAll servers come with private networking - so you can mount a storage disk on a NVMe server and so on (same location only).\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nNetwork (and other) information is available at https://hosthatch.com/features"}
