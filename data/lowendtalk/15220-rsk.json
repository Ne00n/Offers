However, we have been providing webhosting solutions since 2009 locally - in Dubai for young entrepreneurs and startup companies. We are currently holding strong with many, many happy clients :-)\r\n \r\nWhy should you buy now? Well, the answer to that is simple ... if you purchase any of these deals, you get to keep the price for life. If you purchase something for $6.99, you will always pay that and the price will never increase, and you will get the amazing MyRSK experience with it. Plus, if you are not satisfied, we offer 5 days money back no questions asked, guarantee!\r\n \r\nJust a gentle reminder: NO PUBLIC TORRENTING, SPAMMING, AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ALLOWED!\r\n \r\nCzech Republic (Zlin) FDCServers\r\n------------------\r\nOpenVZ\r\n4096MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n400GB HD\r\n4000GB Bandwidth\r\n100mb/s Port\r\nFREE Addons Pack (10GB backup space + hosted DNS!)\r\n$6.99/month only! \r\n[[ORDER](https://myrsk.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=76)]\r\n \r\nGermany (Frankfurt) GhostNet\r\n------------------\r\nOpenVZ\r\n4096MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n100GB HD\r\n1000GB Bandwidth\r\n1gb/s Port\r\nFREE Addons Pack (10GB backup space + hosted DNS!)\r\n$6.99/month only! \r\n[[ORDER](https://myrsk.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=77)]\r\n \r\nUK (Coventry) UKServers\r\n------------------\r\nOpenVZ\r\n3072MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n100GB HD\r\n2000GB Bandwidth\r\n1gb/s Port\r\nFREE Addons Pack (10GB backup space + hosted DNS!)\r\n$6.99/month only! \r\n[[ORDER](https://myrsk.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=79)]\r\n \r\nUS (Kansas City) Datashack\r\n------------------\r\nOpenVZ\r\n3072MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n100GB HD\r\n2000GB Bandwidth\r\n1gb/s Port\r\nFREE Addons Pack (10GB backup space + hosted DNS!)\r\n$6.99/month only! \r\n[[ORDER](https://myrsk.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=78)]\r\n \r\nUK (Coventry) UKServers\r\n------------------\r\nKVM\r\n1024MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n50GB HD\r\n2000GB Bandwidth\r\n100mb/s Port\r\nFREE Addons Pack (10GB backup space + hosted DNS!)\r\n$6.99/month only!\r\n[[ORDER](https://myrsk.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=81)]\r\n \r\nUSA (Atlanta)  COLO@\r\n------------------\r\nKVM\r\n2048MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n50GB HD\r\n2000GB Bandwidth\r\n100mb/s Port\r\nFREE Addons Pack (10GB backup space + hosted DNS!)\r\n$6.99/month only!\r\n[[ORDER](https://myrsk.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=80)]\r\n \r\n \r\nWe DO NOT allow (not limited to) :\r\nPhishing\r\nHacking\r\nPort Scanning\r\nP*rn*graphy (of any kind)\r\nIRC Bots\r\nSpam\r\nProxy\r\nNulled Scripts\r\n\r\nAdditional Information: Windows is possible but we will have to charge an additional $3.01 on the KVM plans, and you have to bring your own license.\r\n \r\n \r\nDatacenter Information and test files : http://myrsk.com/network.php (if links aren't functioning properly, do understand that some test files have been removed and IPs been renumbered - let us know if you require anything though.)\r\n \r\nFor queries or support please submit a ticket : http://myrsk.com/whmcs/submitticket.php\r\n \r\nAddons: \r\nDirectAdmin = $6/month"}
