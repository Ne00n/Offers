I provide e-mail hosting for your domains. I am offering 10% off of all listed packages with promo code &lt;b&gt;MX10&lt;/b&gt;.\r\n\r\n- POP, IMAP, SMTP&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Webmail&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Sieve filters&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Z-Push (works with 1 account per device)&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Control panel based on VestaCP&lt;br&gt;\r\n- Not U.S. hosted (but U.S. owned)&lt;br&gt;\r\n- OwnCloud account for every e-mail account! (512MB Storage for each account, may increase later)\r\n\r\nHere are our packages:\r\n\r\nName: Small&lt;br&gt;\r\nStorage: 5GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDomains/E-mail Accounts: Unlimited&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=19&lt;br&gt;\r\n$10/year\r\n\r\nName: Medium&lt;br&gt;\r\nStorage: 10GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDomains/E-mail Accounts: Unlimited&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=20&lt;br&gt;\r\n$15/year\r\n\r\nName: Large&lt;br&gt;\r\nStorage: 15GB&lt;br&gt;\r\nDomains/E-mail Accounts: Unlimited&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=21&lt;br&gt;\r\n$20/year\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Can you create sub accounts for the control panel?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nNo you cannot.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;How does your spam filtering work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nI take the role of managing the spam filters. If you receive spam it should land in your Spam box. If it lands in your inbox, forward it to spam@mxroute.com for review.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Can I upgrade anytime?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nSure! Just open a ticket.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Can I use my own domain name for IMAP/POP/SMTP?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nSure, but the SSL certificate is signed for *.mxroute.com so your clients will receive a warning message about it when using SSL ports to connect.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Can I customize webmail?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nSure! You can install Roundcube or any other webmail client on your own server and use it to connect to ours over IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Why does MX2 point to the same record as MX1?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nThis is a long term project. Read here: https://billing.mxroute.com/announcements.php?id=25\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Can I forward all of my e-mail to Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, or Hotmail?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nNo. There are alternatives that work just fine:&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttp://email.about.com/od/yahoomailtip1/qt/How_to_Check_Other_Email_Accounts_with_Yahoo_Mail.htm&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttps://support.google.com/mail/answer/21289?hl=en&lt;br&gt;\r\nhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/yahoo-imap\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Can you guarantee that my mail won't land in spam folders?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nNo one can guarantee that. The calculation for most services involves domain + content + IP reputation. I can and will handle the third, but I can't fix a bad reputation with your domain or content."}
