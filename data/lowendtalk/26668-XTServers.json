This would help us shape an offer to fit your needs better.\r\n\r\nHow does this sound for you guys?\r\n\r\n**Dik space:** 50GB (or 5-7GB SSD)\r\n\r\n**Guaranteed RAM:** 1GB\r\n\r\n**No. of cores:** 1\r\n\r\n\r\n**Monthly traffic:** 600GB (we're thinking of increasing to 1TB)\r\n\r\n**No. of IPv4 Addresses:** 1\r\n\r\n**Network port:** 100Mbps (for each VPS, the server has 1Gbps connection)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Location:** Germany\r\n\r\n**Network uptime:** 99.9%\r\n\r\n\r\n**PRICE: 5euro / month (a bit under 7$)**\r\n\r\n\r\nA benchmark for a similar VPS would be: http://www.xtservers.com/blog/2014/01/performance-testbenchmark-29-jan-2014-xvps1/\r\n\r\nWe think it should be a decent offer with NO OVERSELLING. All resources are guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!"}
