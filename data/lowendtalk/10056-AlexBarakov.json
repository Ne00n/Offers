You can request your 5GB free FTP off-site backup space, by opening a ticket.\r\n- MySQL offload - it is still in a beta testing period and currently is free, once it is out of the beta, we will be charging 1 to 2$ per month for the use of it. You can request it by opening a ticket.\r\n- Internal networking and IPs - you can now request internal IPs in our Seattle locations, to load-balance, backup or any other setup you may want to get rolling in our Seattle locations. Traffic through those IPs is not accounted and is free. The IPs are assigned manually, so you would have to contact us to get the IPs allocated to your services.\r\n- Filtered IPs for our KVM nodes - you can now purchase a filtered IP for our Texas KVM location as well\r\n- Reduced filtered IP pricing - we are reducing the filtered IPs pricing from 5$ to 3$, during the period this offer runs.\r\n\r\nNow the offers:\r\n\r\n&gt;2GB \u2013 Special\r\n2GB RAM\r\n512MB vSwap\r\n60GB Disk Space\r\n800GB Bandwidth\r\n1 IPv4 Address\r\nOpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n$7/Month\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=104 - LA\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=102 - Seattle\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=103 - Lenoir\r\n\r\nAnd because I haven't posted any yearly deals for a while:\r\n\r\n&gt;1.5GB special\r\n\u2022 1538MB Ram\r\n\u2022 2048MB Burstable RAM\r\n\u2022 40 GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022 600 GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022 OpenVZ / SolusVM\r\n\u2022 1 x IPv4\r\n\u2022 Seattle, Washington\r\n\u2022 $48/Year\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=82\r\n\r\n&gt;1GB special\r\n\u2022 1024MB Ram\r\n\u2022 1538MB Burstable RAM\r\n\u2022 30 GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022 400 GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022 OpenVZ / SolusVM\r\n\u2022 1 x IPv4\r\n\u2022 Seattle, Washington\r\n\u2022 $35/Year\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=81\r\n\r\n&gt;KVM Special:\r\n\u2022 256MB RAM\r\n\u2022 10 GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022 200 GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022 1 Core\r\n\u2022 KVM / SolusVM\r\n\u2022 1 x IPv4\r\n\u2022 Dallas, Texas\r\n20$ per year\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=83\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of space available across our nodes and we can sell some Storage VPS, custom tailored on requests.\r\n\r\nSome network information:\r\n&gt;Lenoir, North Carolina: 199.241.190.99 @ DaCentec\r\n&gt;Seattle, Washington: 198.23.149.3 @ ColoCrossing\r\n&gt;Los Angeles, California: 198.23.250.138 @ ColoCrossing\r\n&gt;KVM nodes are located in Dallas, Texas with LimeStoneNetworks, test IP: 64.31.0.187\r\n"}
