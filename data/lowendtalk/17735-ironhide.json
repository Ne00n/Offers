But I have no use of this server anymore. So if anyone is willing to buy it for the rest of the time (**9.5 months**), please make an offer or send a PM. Reselling the server from ServerMania is allowed and their support is top-notch ( guaranteed no-canned reply in 15 minutes). I am very happy with their overall service and support. \r\n\r\nThanks"}
