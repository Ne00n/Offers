We may also give away more credit for good suggestions.\r\n\r\nOnly requirement is that your account on LET is more than 1 month old.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to participate, please create an order at &lt;a href=\"https://fast-hosting.net/virtual-servers\"&gt;https://fast-hosting.net/virtual-servers&lt;/a&gt; and us know via ticket that you'd like to join the trial and we'll credit your account.
