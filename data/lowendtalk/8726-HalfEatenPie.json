Or Don Park if you\u2019ve ever had a support ticket answered by me!\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;YOU GUYS ROCK!&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nFor those of you guys who don\u2019t know us, Catalyst Host was started by the Magnificent Ryan Arp ( @ryanarp ) and the Spectacular Jarland Donnell ( @jarland ) focused on providing our brand of hosting.  We just want you all to know that we\u2019re more than just another provider, **all of us at Catalyst are active on LowEndTalk  and are customers too!**  In addition to that we\u2019re also Catalyst customers ourselves!  We want the best out of everything we get, and we\u2019ll work hard to make sure you get the best we can give!  \r\n\r\nWe\u2019d just like to thank our loyal customers for helping us become where we are now!\r\n\r\nThis is the first time Jarland and Ryan has put me in charge of our promotion offer, and although I can\u2019t really beat the bosses I can definitely do the all-time LET classic.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;The Offer&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n**Venti**\r\nLocation: Dallas, Texas, USA\r\n4 CPU Cores (E5-2620)\r\n1024MB RAM\r\n1024MB vSwap\r\n40GB Storage\r\n500GB Bandwidth at 1Gbps\r\n1 User Generated Backup\r\n$7.00/month\r\nhttps://catalysthost.com/clientarea/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=34 **Promo Code:** PIELOVESLET\r\n\r\nWant the other plans?\r\n\r\nWell\u2026  This is what I can do!  \r\n\r\nAll of our VPS Plans on our site work with the **Promo Code**: PIEPAYS25\r\nIts 25% Off on **ALL** VPS Plans!  Just make sure I have enough left for beer! \r\n\r\n**All Promotion Codes are Recurring FOR LIFE!**\r\n\r\nTest IP/File: http://192.211.54.101/100mb.test\r\n\r\nWe have some pretty awesome things lined up, keep an eye out for Catalyst in the news!  \r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Data Backup Policy:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nAll data on these plans are backed up weekly in Dallas and stored offsite. Our backups are for emergencies. Your user generated backups are for small issues. We only guarantee access to our offsite backups if we are responsible for data loss. This helps keep our costs reasonable while providing two different layers of backups for your important data.\r\n&lt;h2&gt;About our Dallas Datacenter:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe network behind our Dallas servers is multi-homed with multiple 10Gbit connections and redundant Juniper routing with HSRP failover. Network and hardware conditions are monitored 24/7/365. Spare hardware is always stocked and available on site. We utilize A+B power for redundancy in case of brownouts, which are rare in Dallas.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Our Hardware Currently:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n2x Xeon E5-2620\r\n64GB ECC Memory\r\n8x 500GB Enterprise SATA\r\nLSI 9260-8i w/BBU &amp; 512MB Cache\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What Makes Catalyst Host a Special Company?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nI could give you so many reasons, but honestly quoting Jarland is probably the best.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do something right, don\u2019t bother doing it.\u201d\r\n\r\nRe-iterating what I said above, we seriously made this company for ourselves.  We wanted a service to our quality, and when we realized that what we were doing actually worked we decided that we shouldn\u2019t keep it for ourselves.   We don\u2019t settle for mediocre, we care about our clients, and in reality this isn\u2019t about the money.    \r\n\r\nAgain, quoting Jarland\u2019s last post\u2026\r\nWe are not here to give you the most imaginary resources you can't use for the least dollar signs. We are here to give you the best quality, with what I estimate to be some of the least oversold nodes in our market. You have the peace of mind that you services are in good hands, that your service will operate as expected, and that your data will remain safe.\r\n\r\nThanks guys, and rock on!\r\n"}
