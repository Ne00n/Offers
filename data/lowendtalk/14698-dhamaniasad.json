This is the cheapest I've ever seen.\r\nAnd they are also offering 512 RAM/512 swap for that price, with 50 GB HDD and 2 TB BW. \r\nSo they have an amazing value for money. \r\nI am not affiliated to crissic.net in any way, just found their offer interesting and thought people here would like it. \r\nFeel free to remove or move my thread if I'm not allowed to post this here."}
