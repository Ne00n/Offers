It's as close as you can get to a dedicated server, without the cost. You're guaranteed a share of the RAM, HDD and CPU on the physical machine, these resources are entirely reserved your usage. Powered by Linux, KVM and Proxmox VE 3.x.\r\n\r\nThe definition of hosting is to store (a website or other data) on a server or other computer so that it can be accessed over the Internet. At Virtual6 we offer three levels of hosting, each offers different features and different levels of isolation depending on your needs.
