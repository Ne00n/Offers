These servers are great for IRC bouncers, DNS, and other light-weight tasks, but also run well in a variety of other tasks, being powered by fast LSI RAID 10 arrays, and Intel E3v2 CPUs. All VPSs are deployed in Dallas, in either the CoreXChange, Equinix and or Telx datacenters. Servers are equipped with redundant networking and redundant power. We recently introduced new networking addons, including internal IPs, and DDOS-protected IPs.\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;128MB Deal&lt;/b&gt;\r\n128MB RAM + 128MB VSwap\r\n500GB bandwidth @ 1Gbp/s\r\n3GB RAID 10 SSD space\r\n1 E3v2 core (fair use)\r\n1 IPv4 address\r\n16 IPv6 addresses\r\nUnmanaged \r\nOpenVZ\r\nPrice: $6.95/semi-annually | &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/11138/servercrate-6-95-128mb-semi-annually-raid-ssds-e3-cpus-ddos-protected-ips-internal-ips\"&gt;Buy Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Addons&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nAdditional IPv4 addresses are $1/IPv4.
