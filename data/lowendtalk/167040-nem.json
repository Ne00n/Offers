Lifetime licenses have been added for **Startup** ($159, 30 domains) and **Mini** ($99, 10 domains) classes which are perfect complements for smaller cloud servers. Pro ($499) has no domain restrictions. A special promotion is available until October 1 to discount these above prices:\r\n\r\nUse coupon code **JOY32** at [checkout](https://my.apiscp.com/) for 50% off any lifetime license.\r\n\r\nLifetime licenses work with all future versions of ApisCP.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince the initial release announcement, 3.2 has continued to evolve, separating Web Apps into their [own modules](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Awebapp+org%3Aapisnetworks&amp;type=Repositories) and adding [Docker](https://docs.apiscp.com/admin/Docker/) support.\r\n\r\nMulti-server support is getting a makeover next. Keep your eyes peeled on [apisnetworks/cp-proxy](https://github.com/apisnetworks/cp-proxy). As requested, MSS will allow jumping between servers as admin and transparent SSO into domains on other servers.\r\n\r\nStay tuned! :heart:\r\n\r\n@jh @webcraft the party has commenced"}
