However, SSD drives are a lot more expensive than HDD and comes with less space. With our SSD acceleration technology (combined with RAID 10 as well), we accelerate your \"hot\" data using SSD, while keeping less-accessed files on the HDD. The whole process is seamless and is done automatically, the result is up to 500% faster disk reading speed!!\r\n With our SSD acceleration technology, you can have near-SSD speed with cheap, HDD-like price.\r\n \r\n **Frequently Asked Questions**\r\n \r\n **Q:** Where is the datacenter located?\r\n \r\n A: We use the ColoCrossing datacenter in Los Angeles. Test IP: 192.210.148.250\r\n \r\n **Q:** What's the virtualization technology that you use?\r\n \r\n A: We use OpenVZ for our servers, we also include a free and easy-to-use VPS management panel for each VPS.\r\n \r\n **Q:** Which payment methods do you accept?\r\n \r\n A: We use PayPal as our payment gateway, you can either use your credit card or your PayPal balance.\r\n \r\n **Q:** Can I purchase additional IP Addresses?\r\n \r\n A: Certainly!
