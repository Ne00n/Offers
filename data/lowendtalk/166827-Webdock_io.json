The industry is so used to optimizing tenant density and is so marked by a reseller culture (It's resellers all the way down!) that people don't realize that us \"near-first-tier operators\" who are in co-location and can take advantage of economies at scale and low overheads, are looking at perfectly adequate profit margins even with an outstanding hardware mix. What we do specifically is:\r\n\r\n- We operate high-quality refurb hardware (typically Dell Poweredge units) in order to cut costs on outlay while providing excellent performance\r\n- Take advantage of Linux Containers as our hypervisor is LXD. Many providers would see this is a good way to increase tenant density. At Webdock we do the opposite: We pass on more hardware resources to you, the end-user.\r\n- We actively balance and adjust capacity according to load. No host is ever allowed to go above 30% utilization sustained\r\n- Compute density is increasing rapidly these years. Within a few years we are looking at deploying kilothread Epyc systems in a 1U package. **That's a lot of flippin' compute.**\r\n- And frankly, maybe we are just not as greedy as so many other providers ?  \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\r\n\r\n### TL;DR: With Webdock, you do actually get what it says on the sticker.!\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# Helsinki Finland. So, this is just Hetzner, right?\r\n\r\nYes and no. As stated we **operate our own hardware** in co-location and in the EU we have chosen Hetzner as our co-location partner. This means that **we own our own racks** in the Hetzner Datacenter, **we operate our own IPv4 blocks** ( [RIPE](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=ripe&amp;key=ORG-WA586-RIPE&amp;type=organisation) ) and Hetzner merely supplies the redundant power and network connections. Add to that the fantastic level of technical expertise in their datacenters and fantastic DDOS protection, you get the best of both worlds with Webdock.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# That's not a lot of SSD Storage - what about hardware upgrades?\r\nA primary reason we do not offer as much storage included in our base packages as the competition is because we use **on-board storage** and not network-attached storage. In our largest profiles this is RAIDed Nvme drives and in our smaller profiles this is RAIDed enterprise SSD drives (SATA+ZFS). We opted for this route in order to provide excellent performance, first and foremost.\r\n\r\nWe offer a range of expansion options to our base profiles. All our profiles can be upgraded or downgraded without any downtime and in addition you can get a range of hardware upgrades, including:\r\n\r\n- On-Board HDD backed Storage mounted in a directory of your choosing\r\n**\u20ac0.075 /Month /GB**\r\n\r\n- Expanding your SSD root storage volume\r\n**\u20ac 0.125 /Month /GB**\r\n\r\nIn addition you can order additional IPv4 addresses, more RAM etc. Please take a look at our [Additional Products page](https://webdock.io/en/docs/webdock/billing-pricing/additional-products) for full pricing and details.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# Webdock is probably not suited for most resellers\r\n\r\nAs our hypervisor is LXD on Ubuntu we are not suited for something like installing KVM. We do support nested containers (LXD and Docker), but you are loosing control of certain aspects which you may want to tweak if you want to further slice up our VPS's. We also do not support CentOS so cpanel is a no go. **However** we do have quite a few shared-host resellers on our platform that use 3rd party control panels such as Runcloud and Serverpilot. We would just like to leave you with this quote from one of our customers:\r\n\r\n&gt; i'm really in love with Webdock, it was such a breeze moving my sites from an old dedicated server which was far more costly. It's so nice having everything I need already installed (MySQL, PHP, composer, git, etc). Control panel is really nice. All the extras like shell users, certificates, crons, etc, spot on! **So happy to be done with Cpanel forever now**. -Nate, USA\r\n\r\nSo for single site -&gt; Single (awesome) server type reselling, Webdock has a pretty sweet control panel you might want to give a chance.\r\n\r\nIn addition Webdock is **fully GDPR compliant** and you can easily generate a DPA between you and your clients you may be reselling to within the European Union. Also, Webdock has really been built from the ground up with agencies and \"premium reselling\" in mind - not shared hosting / lowest common denominator hosting. We certainly will not stop you from doing so, but if you care about more than reaching the lowest possible cost we urge you to consider a 1 server = 1 app/website approach as the benefits are many.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, we are releasing our API within 1-2 weeks where we will have SDKs for Python, NodeJS and PHP right out the gate and shortly following that we will release a (free) WHMCS integration plugin, so that could be an option for you if you are looking to resell Webdock in more of a shared-setup with automated billing etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n### What are your terms and conditions?\r\n\r\nOur terms and conditions are pretty awesome, actually. You should check them out. Here are some links to all the legal nitty-gritty:\r\n\r\n- [Terms and Conditions. No bullshit guarantees.](https://webdock.io/en/docs/legal-stuff/terms-and-conditions)\r\n- [Billing &amp; Pricing, Trial Periods and more ](https://webdock.io/en/docs/webdock/billing-pricing)\r\n- [Privacy and GDPR.](https://webdock.io/en/docs/legal/privacy-policy)\r\n\r\n### Where are your Datacenters located?\r\nWe are in co-location with Hetzner in Helsinki Finland (details above). In the USA, Dallas TX, we lease hardware from Servermania - thus the lower specs on those servers. At the moment we are all sold out of servers in Dallas however but we are in the process of deploying more servers there which should become available within the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try out Webdock, it is a breeze to move servers between regions - so there is nothing stopping you from provisioning a server in Finland and then later migrating it to the US (you will obviously receive a new IP address when doing so)\r\n\r\n### What is your Refund Policy?\r\nWe refund all unused compute time down to the day instantly and directly to your payment method as soon as you delete a server. As simple as that.\r\n\r\n### Supported payment types?\r\nWe only support Credit Cards with Stripe as our payment processor at the moment. Later this year we will roll out Paypal and AliPay support.\r\n\r\n### Do you price match?\r\nNot really something we have had to deal with, ever. But if you find something that's a VPS with better specs shoot us a message and we will take a look. We don't promise anything as there's lots more included than just hardware in our platform (such as our expansive feature set and 3rd party services, stellar support and more).\r\n\r\n### Test IP?\r\nSince all servers are essentially free for the first 24 hours with Webdock, regardless of coupons or not, we urge you to simply create a server with us and run some tests. This makes more sense than us reserving some \"golden ip\" for you to test against.\r\n\r\n### What Operating Systems are available?\r\n\r\nWe only support Ubuntu in a few version flavors at the moment and do not plan on expanding to other OS's at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# Select Customer Reviews\r\n\r\n&gt; \u201cQuality, Security &amp; performance, 1 push of a button.. Webdock gives it all! Even their customer support has a high performance - Yoram, Netherlands\r\n\r\n \r\n&gt; \u201c Free transactional email from Postmark? Absolutely love your rock bottom prices! You guys are killing it! You've built something really really cool here. - Pratheek, India\r\n\r\n \r\n&gt; \u201cYou all seem to be really on top of your game - Alexander, Spain\r\n\r\n \r\n&gt; \u201cHonestly i've tried like 5 different hosting companies today and yours was the best, you have the most intuitive GUI and start up was the fastest. - Hayden, Canada\r\n\r\n \r\n&gt; \u201cHow have I never heard of you? This is awesome! - Tobias, USA\r\n"}
