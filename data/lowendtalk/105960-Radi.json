You will be able to create and destroy VPS on your own, paying a fixed monthly price. No need to keep ordering and cancelling services for your temporary projects. If you just need a server for short time multiple times a month, this is the best thing for you. There will be more pool offers next time. :)\r\n\r\n**2 GB RAM Resource Pool**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nMax Disk Space: 60 GB\r\nMax RAM: 2 GB\r\nMax Burst RAM: 4 GB\r\nMax Bandwidth: 4 TB\r\nMax CPU Cores: 4\r\nMax IPv4: 2\r\nLocation: Buffalo\r\nVirtualization: OpenVZ\r\n\r\nThis is a resource pool.

We do not want to forget existing clients as well on these plans. If you have a Xen Dallas or Xen Buffalo plan, when your next invoice comes, before paying it open a ticket and write the following code: E67438995A in order to get this discount for your next invoice:\r\n\r\n30% for annual billing cycle or 15% for monthly billing cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Useful info:**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nAll offers are powered by Virtualizor control panel. \r\nAll offers come with 1 IPv4 unless otherwise stated. \r\nUSD pricing is posted based on the today's exchange rate. \r\n1 EUR=1.05550 USD. \r\nIPv6 right now is available in Dallas and Sweden.\r\nrDNS is available for Dallas and Sweden.\r\nWe provide best-effort application support.\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n**About us:**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\ndrServer started offering service around November of 2013, so we're 3 years old.\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n**Useful Links Section:**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nTerms of Service: https://vikinglayer.com/tos.php\r\nAUP: https://vikinglayer.com/aup.php\r\nTicket us: https://vikinglayer.com/clients/submitticket.php?step=2&amp;deptid=1\r\nForum: https://forum.drserver.net\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n**FAQ:**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nQ: Do you allow gameservers?\r\nBecause most gameservers generally attract (D)DoS attacks, we currently do not allow them on our network. \r\nThis also applies to voiceservers such as Teamspeak and Mumble.\r\nQ: Can I run a VPN?\r\nPrivate VPN servers are perfectly fine with us.
