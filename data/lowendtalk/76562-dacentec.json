We control the entire building, so emergency changes and fixes don't require a landlord approval or outside assistance.\r\n* Redundant utility power feeds from Duke Energy. Dual power feeds from two substations take diverse paths to our site where we have redundant transformers.\r\n* Redundant A+B generators. Many sites have redundant power, but share a single ATS/Genset. A and B power have isolated generators.\r\n* Redundant cooling sytems. Our unique design uses hot air containment and 'air corridors'. Servers share CRACs (Computer Room Air Conditioners) for redundancy.\r\n* Redundant Eaton 9395 UPS. Redundant UPS manufactured right here in North Carolina.\r\n* Dedicated facilities and electrical staff. Electrical work is done by Centrilogic employees who work full time at the site all year long.\r\n* Staff and Support. Dacentec is staffed by rotating shifts of dedicated Centrilogic employees. Average tenure is over 3 years.\r\n* The backing and support of Centrilogic, one of the best names in enterprise, hybrid and managed hosting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Dacentec Difference**\r\n\r\n* 7 Day no questions asked money back guarantee for accounts without spam or abuse.\r\n* No notification period for cancellations.
