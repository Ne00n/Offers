VPS is paid through 9/20/2013.\r\n\r\nI would like to trade for a non-US VPS, at least 128/256 ram, 2 gigs disk, and 10 gigs of transfer per month, and prepaid through at least 7/01/2013\r\n\r\nPrefer Prometeus VZ0, but any reputable provider will do.\r\n\r\np.s.\r\n\r\nSemoWeb rocks, btw. Have had the VPS for 32 days, and my uptime is 32 days. If they were not in the U.S.A. I would totally marry SemoWeb :D\r\n\r\n"}
