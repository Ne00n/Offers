As an Australian business Singapore was a logical step for a new POP in South East Asia to make services available to our neighbours (and we ran out of cities in Australia to cover). We have a new POP at SG3 Equinix ready for VPS services (with dedicated servers planned as well). In the next 2 months capacity between Singapore and Perth will be added to further improve connectivity back into Australia on the new Vocus 'Australia Singapore Cable'. We own all our hardware and are not a reseller of services.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://singapore-lg.ransomit.com.au\"&gt;Looking Glass&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nPayments by PayPal or credit card.\r\n\r\n1GB RAM, 20GB SSD storage, 2 Cores, 1TB transfer\r\n$21 USD p/quarter\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://secure.ransomit.com.au/console/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=267\"&gt;Order Link&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a higher end plan we are offering a discount of 20% on the higher end (2GB, 4GB and 8GB RAM KVM plans) till 31st October or while we have stock! &lt;a href=\"https://ransomit.com.au/singapore-vps/\"&gt;Just head to our website&lt;/a&gt; and then use the promotion code **MERLION** in the shopping cart to get a recurring 20% off your Singapore KVM VPS service!"}
