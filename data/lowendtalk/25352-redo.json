This is my first time selling a server, so please tell me if I'm doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nI have a customized yearly plan with WeLoveServers\r\n\r\n    6GB RAM\r\n    6GB vSwap\r\n    8 vCPU Cores\r\n    75GB Disk space\r\n    2000GB Bandwidth\r\n    1Gbps uplink\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    OpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n\r\nThe renew date is 01/10/2014.  Location is Dallas, but you can ask to move it around their locations.\r\n\r\nThis is a customized deal for me in which I paid high in first year and from next years I can re-order with $44. As I don't need it now, I want to sell it for $50 to recover my initial payment.\r\n\r\nThe math should be:\r\n\r\n    $50 for 5 months\r\n    $44 for another 12 months\r\n    = $94 for 17 months\r\n    = $5.5 per month\r\n\r\nYou have to have (or create) a account at WeLoveServers, and then support will transfer the server from my account to your account. I want the payment to my paypal account.\r\n\r\nWeLoveServers support has agreed about this transfer.\r\n\r\n(this is a copy from recent post of @myhken. Thx :D)"}
