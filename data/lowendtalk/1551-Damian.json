Let's see how it goes.\r\n\r\nAdam and I have been doing Internet services since 2003 as Digital Design Core. We moved into the VPS market in May of 2011 as IPXcore. We started this because we were on a BurstNET node that kept getting oversold, and we were unable to get any form of support. We decided that we could do better.\r\n\r\nAll of our nodes are located at Phoenix Internet in Phoenix, AZ, and transited through a mix of twtelecom and Qwest/Centurylink. Many of our Asian customers tell us they get great connectivity on this mix.\r\n\r\nWe're running OpenVZ virtualization on our very own Dell and HP hardware. We're running a mix of Xeon- and Opteron-powered hardware; if you have a preference, please open a support ticket with us.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE NOTE: Each *connection* is limited to 20 mbit/sec. Your VPS will be able to pull multiple 20 mbit/sec connections.**\r\n\r\nWe're offering our usual plans, but with some fun coupon codes to cut prices:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;TinyVPS&lt;/b&gt;\r\n1/2 CPU core\r\n96mb RAM\r\n2gb Disk Space\r\n30gb bandwidth\r\n\r\nNormally $1.99 per month.\r\n\r\nYour choice of two coupon codes for this:\r\n\r\nLETTINY40FEB12 - 40% off your first month = $1.20, then $1.99 per month\r\nLETTINY10FEB12 - 10% off recurring = $1.79 per month\r\n\r\nLink: https://ipxcore.com/order/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;IronVPS&lt;/b&gt;\r\n2 CPU cores\r\n128mb RAM\r\n192mb burst RAM (vswap available on request)\r\n10gb Disk Space\r\n200gb bandwidth\r\n\r\nNormally $4.49 per month.\r\n\r\nYour choice of two coupon codes for this:\r\n\r\nLET50FEB12 - 50% off your first month = $2.25, then $4.49 per month\r\nLET20FEB12 - 20% off recurring = $3.59 per month\r\n\r\nLink: https://ipxcore.com/order/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=2\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;BronzeVPS&lt;/b&gt;\r\n4 CPU cores\r\n256mb RAM\r\n320mb burst RAM (vswap available on request)\r\n20gb Disk Space\r\n300gb bandwidth\r\n\r\nNormally $6.99 per month.\r\n\r\nYour choice of two coupon codes for this:\r\n\r\nLET50FEB12 - 50% off your first month = $3.49, then $6.99 per month\r\nLET20FEB12 - 20% off recurring = $5.59 per month\r\n\r\nLink: https://ipxcore.com/order/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=3\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTest IP: 216.224.230.133\r\nTraceroute: http://onyx.ipxcore.com/traceroute.php\r\n\r\nAdditional IPv4 addresses available for $3.00 per month apiece, with justification.\r\nWe're working on IPv6; we hope to be able to participate in World IPv6 Launch Day, if not sooner.\r\n\r\nNeed additional CPU cores/ram/disk space/bandwidth?
