We\u2019ve been going now for nearly a year and have the likes of Google, Zynga and the UK Government using our services and in our last customer survey over 95% of our customers were happy with our service. \r\n\r\nWe consider ourselves a reactive company and we\u2019ve build a product that we\u2019re proud of and that our users have had a huge amount of impact in shaping. You can add Ping tests, HTTP tests and TCP tests.\r\n\r\nToday also marks the first day of our Full Site Scan beta.
