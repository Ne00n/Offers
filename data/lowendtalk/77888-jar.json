Great inbound spam filtering with near zero false positives.  \r\n2. Exceptional inbox delivery rates.\r\n\r\nLet's face it, email is frustrating, or it costs a lot of money. Rarely do we see both of those problems solved at once. The idea behind MXroute is not to be anything fancy, rather let you get back to doing what you do best: not spending hours dealing with delivery issues to Microsoft.\r\n\r\nSome of the features of MXroute:\r\n\r\n- Server-side email filters  \r\n- Email forwarding  \r\n- MailChannels for outgoing email  \r\n- POP3 / IMAP / SMTP  \r\n- Roundcube / Squirrelmail / Horde Webmail  \r\n- Z-Push (limited functionality, but it works)  \r\n- Backup and download your data at any time  \r\n- cPanel based control  \r\n- Low prices!\r\n\r\nA lot of people ask us why they should use a cPanel based email hosting service as opposed to shared hosting, and that's a great question. You can find the in depth answer here:  \r\nhttp://billing.mxroute.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=12\r\n\r\nThe Offer:\r\n\r\n- Unlimited Domains  \r\n- Unlimited Email Accounts  \r\n- 30GB Storage (total for the entire account)  \r\n- $25/year  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=43\"&gt;Order here&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nNote: While there are no limits on email sending, we ask that you not use it as a replacement for a bulk email service where you may be sending tens of thousands of emails per day. Full disclosure: Our cost for outgoing mail with MailChannels does involve a sending limit, and that limit will increase with the growth of MXroute. Obviously, one $25/year customer would not be worth $500/m in overages, so if you are concerned that your volume may be an issue, feel free to ask."}
