The entire platform is Xen-based and managed by OnApp. More information, including speed test files etc., is of course on the website but I wanted to emphasise what's really special about this offer, our unique \"Zero Downtime or Zero Invoice\" guarantee.\r\n\r\nEssentially this is a way to pick up a high-end cloud server at a reduced price. The specs are fairly low but if you need something that's powerful and reliable then this is for you.\r\n\r\nSo here are the specs (increased slightly from the LEB post)...\r\n**3GB SAS 15K SAN Disk\r\n128MB RAM\r\n100GB Bandwidth\r\n\u00a33.75/month (+VAT where applicable)**\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions just reply to this thread, email, telephone or live chat us. Also to address a past concern about ticket response times, a new member of staff, Dan Smith has just joined our team and response times have already come down.\r\n\r\n[Order Link](http://www.theukcloud.com/order/?vps=LOWENDBOX-BETA&amp;msl=0&amp;location=uk)\r\n\r\nPlease remember that we are beta testing at the moment, so it's important to keep a backup of your data."}
