All nodes at this location come with RAID-10 SSD storage by default.\r\n\r\nIf you have a VPS with us, you can migrate it over to this new location (\"Migrate to another DC\" in the KiwiVM panel).\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a VPS with us, then you should get one.\r\n\r\n2) New Micro plans (yes, those are YEARLY prices):\r\n\r\n[MICRO-64 $3.99/year 64MB RAM 1.5GB SSD 100GB Bandwidth on GigE](https://bandwagonhost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=19)\r\n\r\n[MICRO-96 $4.99/year 96MB RAM 2.0GB SSD 200GB Bandwidth on GigE](https://bandwagonhost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=20)\r\n\r\n[MICRO-128 $5.99/year 128MB RAM 3.0GB SSD 300GB Bandwidth on GigE](https://bandwagonhost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=21)\r\n\r\n\r\nLocations:\r\n\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\nPhoenix, Arizona\r\n\r\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\r\n\r\nPlatform: OpenVZ, control panel: KiwiVM\r\n\r\n3) KiwiVM kicks ass, as always! Ticketless migrations between datacenters, automatic migrations from other providers, snapshots (create/restore), automatic OpenVPN installer, 2 factor authentication, all this good stuff is in the KiwiVM for you to play with. A friend of mine once said he likes KiwiVM more than his girlfriend."}
