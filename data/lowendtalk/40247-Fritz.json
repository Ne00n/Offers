Since this is a special plan, it is not listed anymore on their site.\r\nAnyone wants to grab it? I haven't renew it yet. To get it you must be a registered client at Comforthost and I have confirmed this that they allow this.\r\n\r\n### Here is the plan, price recurring at $10.99/year:\r\n\r\nLocation: Florida (some says it is in Illinois, some in Buffalo)\r\n\r\n    * Disk Space: 15 GB\r\n    * Bandwidth: 500 GB\r\n    * Memory: 256 MB\r\n    * VSwap: 256 MB\r\n    * IPv4 Address: 1\r\n    * IPv6 Address: -\r\n    * ISP: Hostdime\r\n\r\n"}
