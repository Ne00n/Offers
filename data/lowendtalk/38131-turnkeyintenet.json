Dedicated servers, custom orders, and colocation services are typically ready same business day.

Legal adult content permitted on dedicated servers only. Please see our Terms of Service for complete details.\r\n\r\nHow are your prices so low?\r\nWhile it may seem incredible to offer these amazing prices and discounts, the reality is that in the data center and cloud hosting business, electricity is the largest expense. With our new on-site solar power system, we produce our own energy. The energy we use in excess of that comes from clean, renewable, hydro-electric power, sourced from Niagara Falls, New York, at a substantially reduced cost for power compared to traditional data centers. Our other green technology investments, such as Smart Aisle precision cooling and cold containment systems, provide an additional 33% efficiency over traditional data centers, further reducing our electricity utilization. This all adds up to entirely renewable electricity, and a zero carbon footprint, as evidenced by our EPA ENERGY STAR certification. Ultimately, this adds up to a lower cost of providing our reliable service. Lastly, we own and operate our own facility, servers, routers, and network connections. We are not resellers or wholesalers, so we do not have the higher operating costs of renting servers and equipment. This allows us to pass down the savings to our customers.\r\n\r\nWhere are the servers located?\r\nThese specials are available in our ENERGY STAR certified, GREEN data center, in New York\u2019s Tech Valley Region.\r\n\r\nDo you have a money back guarantee?\r\nYes. A 30-day, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee is available to all new customers.\r\n\r\nWhy host with TurnKey Internet?\r\nTurnKey Internet provides superior hosting performance at affordable prices, backed with bullet-proof reliability and a 100% network up-time guarantee. We offer the latest in technology, including green, renewable power produced on-site at our data center. Fully-managed services allow you peace of mind with off-site backups, firewall setup, and 24/7 system administration support.
