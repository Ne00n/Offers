Until 2005, we focused mainly on corporate customers and fully integrated solutions (ISP &amp; eCommerce, BPM) - with the advent of affordable mainstream virtualisation (i.e. not AIX or Solaris as hosts, for example), we increasingly opened up to customers qualifying as small companies (&lt; 50 employees) who now amount to ~20% of our customer base.\r\n\r\nWe own all our equipment, and we are 100% self financed. Over 50 developers, sysadmins, and support/administrative staff work with us. We proudly sponsor CentOS, LXCenter (Kloxo, HyperVM), and over 50 projects for environmental protection and sustainable development.\r\n\r\nWe have PoPs in London Telehouse, Manchester Synergy House, a second PoP in Manchester (not advertised), in Ashburn, VA, Fremont, CA, Hannover, DE, and Vienna, AT. We plan 2 more PoPs until April 2013 (DE/Western Europe, and UA). "}
