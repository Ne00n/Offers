My name is Pete, and I am Marc's younger brother who started PhoenixVPS in 2011. I have been really intrigued by the idea of providing high quality - low cost VPS servers that adhere to the LET philosophy of doing the most with the least amount of resources. At the same time neither me, nor Marc like the idea of overselling/overcommitting resources, so when I started working on KVM.SH my first thought was to build the nodes with the assumption that every customer uses all the resources that he or she is paying for.\r\n\r\nMy secondary goal was to keep things as simple as possible. We managed to compress almost the entire web site in one page and we have also simplified the ordering system, billing system and the customer portal for customers. The results speak for themselves as customers can focus on their work instead of having to navigate their way through complicated menus, tabs and pages.\r\n\r\nAfter working very hard to bring this new hosting service to you, I wanted to bring our new service plans to the attention of this community. Our plans start at $2.33/mo. (billed quarterly) for 256MB RAM and 10GB SSD powered storage and go all the way up to 8GB RAM and 320GB SSD powered storage for $56/mo. While this of course this last plan does not fit the $7 criteria, the reason why I am bringing it up is because we have priced our VPS packages from 1GB to 8GB in multiples of 7. Yes, the prices are very competitive, the hardware is solid and the nodes are plenty.\r\n\r\nAs a token of my appreciation, in addition to our great pricing I am also taking an additional 25% off our hosting packages starting from 1GB and up to 8GB for the next 72 hours.
