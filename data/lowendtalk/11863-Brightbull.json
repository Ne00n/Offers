We have a high standard for our performance and therefor only use top grade SSD servers, or SSD cached servers, with speeds of over 1GB/s or 450MB/s for our cached nodes. We have been active since the beginning of '13, and gotten some great feedback from known members of the community.\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n**Hardware &amp; Network SSD**\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Xeon E3-1270v2&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;32GB DDR3 ECC RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;4 X Samsung 840Pro RAID10&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;100Mbit Node&gt;Switch&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Native IPv6&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\nPROMOTION: Use **SUMMERSALE** to get 41% off all plans* **LIFETIME**!\r\n\r\n*Excludes our 128 and 256 plans, max 50 uses.\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\nTOS TLDR: Anything that is illegal in the United States is not allowed.
