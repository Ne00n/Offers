You can request your 5GB free FTP off-site backup space, by opening a ticket.\r\n- MySQL offload - it is still in a beta testing period and currently is free, once it is out of the beta, we will be charging 1 to 2$ per month for the use of it. You can request it by opening a ticket.\r\n- Internal networking and IPs - you can now request internal IPs in our Seattle locations, to load-balance, backup or any other setup you may want to get rolling in our Seattle locations. Traffic through those IPs is not accounted and is free. The IPs are signed manually, so you would have to contact us to get the IPs allocated to your services.\r\n- Filtered IPs for our KVM nodes - you can now purchase a filtered IP for our Texas KVM location as well\r\n- Reduced filtered IP pricing - we are reducing the filtered IPs pricing from 5$ to 3$, during this offer runs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the offers:\r\n&gt; 2GB \u2013 Special\r\n2GB RAM\r\n512MB vSwap\r\n60GB Disk Space\r\n800GB Bandwidth\r\n1 IPv4 Address\r\nOpenVZ/SolusVM\r\n$7/Month\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=104 - LA\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=102 - Seattle\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=103 - Lenoir\r\n\r\nAnd because I haven't posted any yearly deals for a while:\r\n\r\n&gt;1.5GB special\r\n\u2022\t1538MB Ram\r\n\u2022\t2048MB Burstable RAM\r\n\u2022\t40 GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022\t600 GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022\tOpenVZ / SolusVM\r\n\u2022\t1 x IPv4\r\n\u2022\tSeattle, Washington\r\n\u2022\t$48/Year\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=82\r\n\r\n&gt;1GB special\r\n\u2022\t1024MB Ram\r\n\u2022\t1538MB Burstable RAM\r\n\u2022\t30 GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022\t400 GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022\tOpenVZ / SolusVM\r\n\u2022\t1 x IPv4\r\n\u2022\tSeattle, Washington\r\n\u2022\t$35/Year\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=81\r\n\r\n&gt;KVM Special:\r\n\u2022\t256MB RAM\r\n\u2022\t10 GB Disk Space\r\n\u2022\t200 GB Bandwidth\r\n\u2022\t1 Core\r\n\u2022\tKVM / SolusVM\r\n\u2022\t1 x IPv4\r\n\u2022\tDallas, Texas\r\n20$ per year\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=83\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of space available across our nodes and we can sell some Storage VPS, custom tailored on requests.\r\n\r\n**Some network information:**\r\nLenoir, North Carolina: 199.241.190.99 @ DaCentec\r\nSeattle, Washington: 198.23.149.3 @ ColoCrossing\r\nLos Angeles, California: 198.23.250.138 @ ColoCrossing\r\nKVM nodes are located in Dallas, Texas with LimeStoneNetworks, test IP: 64.31.0.187"}
