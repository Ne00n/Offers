If not, don't hesitate to tell me.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I ordered a mKS 2G + Plesk licence on OVH.ie for 6 months.\r\nI used 1 month of service and can't get a refund. I won't use the server so if someone would like to pay me and get the server I'd be happy. I'm leaving because I just learned that OVH now has a datacenter in Beauharnois, QC, Canada and I live in QC, Canada :-)\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nKimsufi mKS 2G - 6 months From 13-01-2013 to 13-07-2013\r\nPlesk license 30 domains - 6 months From 13-01-2013 to 13-07-2013\r\nAdditional IP - 6 months From 13-01-2013 to 13-07-2013\r\nProcessor: Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N2800 @ 1.86GHz\r\n\r\nI paid \u20ac107.94.\r\nI asked a refund from OVH.ie for \u20ac89.95 (5 months of services)\r\nI'd like to get $100USD (\u20ac75) back, you save $20.\r\nIf I see that my offer is not popular I'm ready to take the best offer.\r\n\r\nIf you need anything please let me know."}
