Not long ago, we soft launched KVM to existing customers... and\r\n\r\n**Today, HostUS is relaunching KVM to the general public!**\r\n\r\nWe realise KVM is 'complex' to some buyers who like the automatic OS installation approach in\r\nOpenVZ via templates. So we support similar automatic installation images in KVM (\u201cAuto\r\nRebuild Templates\u201d). For those who like to tweak their OS installs, we also support ISO\r\ninstallations. You can use either from within the Breeze control panel. Yes, KVM will run\r\nWindows, BSD and other OSes that OpenVZ cannot.\r\n\r\nWe know many customers might not understand the differences between KVM and OpenVZ,\r\nbesides one costing more. We have a short comparison of these virtualisation types here:\r\nhttps://hostus.us/openvz-vs-kvm.html. \r\n\r\nIf you still have questions about which virtualisation is best for your use, contact our Sales team directly:\r\nhttps://my.hostus.us/submitticket.php?step=2&amp;deptid=1\r\n\r\n**Performance + Reliability + Support = HostUS**\r\n\r\nFor our KVM hostnodes we are using single / dual Xeon CPUs, DDR3 / DDR4 RAM, backed by drives configured in RAID 10 and with a SSD cache on top. Connectivity is gigabit speed (shared / fair use).\r\n\r\n**KVM Launch Specials**\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nUse coupon code: &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;LETKVM20&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to save 20% off of ANY KVM plan.
