Send me an email Andrew@WePwn.net with your resource requirements as well as the purpose for the resources you are requesting. I have several IPs available and the server is nowhere near capacity.\r\n\r\nIf you are a problem on the node, you will be removed quickly so don't try any illegal stuff. This server is based in the US so copyright law applies and I will not provide servers for Torrenting or file sharing. If I find you doing anything prohibited I will wipe your VM and will not offer a backup. Be warned.\r\n\r\nIf you've got this far and are a resident of Canada or the US please feel free to make a request.\r\n\r\nI also have gitlab running and am happy to offer free repos to any developers who may need space or just a place to work.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAndrew"}
