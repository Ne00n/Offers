We are a privately held company with NO other investors. We treat each and every one of our clients with the utmost respect that they highly deserve. All plans are now semi-managed, this means we can troubleshoot issues for you such as but not limited to \u201cNetwork Issues, Load issues and I/O Issues\u201d Tasks excluded from our semi-management is task such as setting up your scripts, installing and configuring PHP etc. \r\n \r\nWe keep our nodes and networks protected from abuse and spammers. By default port 25 is \r\nblocked switch level; this can be removed by simply submitting a ticket. We don't allow spammers and abusers on our network, so if you plan to order a VM, SPAM and DDoS, then prepare to not get a refund, because of these practices, our node uptime is low end industry leading with super fast I/O usage and low CPU usage. \r\n\r\n\r\nTypical virtual private servers are costly and are oversold, which make them slow and unresponsive. HostUS powered OpenVZ servers ensure that there is no over-selling, and that performance is available 24/7 on demand by the customer. Handle very large amounts of data processing with extremely powerful dual processor server nodes, powered by RAID10 with a BBU disk configuration. All our nodes are connected with 2 x 1 Gbps ports (Bonded) and each VPS is limited to 900Mbit/s. We own and operate most our hardware such as our primary switch; Juniper EX3200-24T Switch with a 10 Gbps uplink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Minimum Node Specifications**\r\n\r\n+ OpenVZ Visualization\r\n+ Dual Xeon L5639 Processors\r\n+ 4x 2TB SATA II Drives\r\n+ LSI Hardware RAID-10 w/ BBU Configuration\r\n+ 72GB DDR3 ECC RAM\r\n+ 2 x Gbps Public (Bonded) and 1 x Gbps Internal/Private\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**LET Exclusive Special-1**\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n4 vCPU Cores @ 2.2Ghz Fair Share&lt;br /&gt;\r\n3 GB DDR3 RAM &lt;br /&gt;\r\n3 GB SWAP &lt;br /&gt;\r\n150 GB HW Raid-10 Disk Space&lt;br /&gt;\r\n5000 GB Bandwidth, 700mbps Up-link&lt;br /&gt;\r\n3 x IPv4 Addresses (With Automatic rDNS) &lt;br /&gt;\r\n$7 /month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n$18 /Quarter (***Pay Quarterly and receive double RAM! 6GB RAM / 6GB vSWAP**)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nOrder - https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=64&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n \r\n**\r\nLET Exclusive Special-2**\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n4 vCPU Cores @ 2.2Ghz Fair Share&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 GB DDR3 RAM &lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 GB SWAP &lt;br /&gt;\r\n50 GB HW Raid-10 Disk Space&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1000 GB Bandwidth, 700mbps Up-link&lt;br /&gt;\r\n1 x IPv4 Addresses (With Automatic rDNS) &lt;br /&gt;\r\n$4 /month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n$10 /Quarter (***Pay Quarterly and receive double RAM! 2GB RAM / 2GB vSWAP**)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\nOrder - https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=65&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\nUpgrades\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n+ Additional IP Each: 50c per IP w/ IP Justification&lt;br /&gt;\r\n+ 5 Usable IPs $4.00 /month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n+ 13 Usable IPs $8.00 /month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n+ 29 Usable IPs $15.00 /month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n+ Unlimited Internal IP's $0.00 /month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n+ cPanel VPS Licence $13/month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n+ WHMCS Licence (Branded) $14/month&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n**Network** &lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nAll our servers are located in Atlanta, Georgia - 55. \r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nLooking glass: http://atl-lg.hostus.us/\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nIP SWIP Is available as well, please create a ticket after order with either your ORG-ID or the organisation name you would like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nBest regards,&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAlexander McNeil&lt;br /&gt;\r\nHostUS Solutions LTD&lt;br /&gt;"}
