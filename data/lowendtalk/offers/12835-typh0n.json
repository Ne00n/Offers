I ordered it on saturday and I just needed to check something, so I don't need it anymore. It's a linux vserver (VRS) with 256 MB RAM and 5120 MB disk. Payed until the 16.09.2013.\r\nI don't know if Edis offers to transfer a VPS and if it's worth the work. If they don't offer it, I will not extend. Please send me a PM if you want it. I give it away for free but feel free to give me a litte tip."}
