Spent countless of hours reworking the logic, and trying to see what I could do, even though I'm limited as WHMCS is fully encrypted. Oh well, UI wise, I believe we achieved a good result. I'm pretty sure there will be some bugs.\r\n\r\nA Roadmap will be published soon (tm).\r\n\r\nEnjoy the video - please make sure to set it in Fullscreen.\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRnVLQzrtXw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\n**Coupon for 50%: YAY**\r\n\r\nApplicable to all plans, including reseller. paid annually and recurring.\r\n\r\nHere's the only eligible plan to list here:\r\n\r\nEmail Hosting - _Powered by MailChannels &amp; CrossBox_\r\n\r\n**Personal**\r\n\r\n5\u20ac/ month\r\n20 GB SSD Storage\r\nUnlimited Domains\r\nUnlimited Email Accounts\r\nMailChannels Email Delivery\r\nWhite-label CrossBox, cPanel, MX\r\n\r\n**[Register and Order](https://iroute.io/console/register.php)**\r\n\r\nWe seriously hope you guys like the new client UI, we worked our asses off!\r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\nMiguel\r\n"}
