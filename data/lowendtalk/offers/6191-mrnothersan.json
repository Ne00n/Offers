I was asking about \u00a360 per month till June for it, which is excessive for the specs.\r\n\r\nI've now lowered it to \u00a336 per month till June (last payment in June). In June, you could either continue with the co-lo contract or take the servre out of the DC. You'd own the server so it would be up to you.\r\n\r\nThere is also a buyout option \r\n\r\nServer Specs: Dell R210 II, i3-2100, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD\r\nCo-lo Specs: 0.5A power, 500GB Bandwidth 10Mbit port (100Mbit upgrade for free)\r\n\r\nLocation: Milton Keynes, UK\r\nDC: Host-IT Tier 3/4\r\n\r\nLast time - and it's at a much better price now and I'm sorry that I didn't put it at that before.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nDominic L"}
