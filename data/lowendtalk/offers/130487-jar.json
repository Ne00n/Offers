One I've been offering with minimal advertising, and one that I've been asked over and over to bring back. Let's go straight to the offers:\r\n\r\nPackage: FIVE  \r\nStorage: 5GB  \r\nFeatures: Unlimited domains, unlimited email addresses  \r\nLimitations: 60 outbound emails per hour (not enforced unless your sending becomes problematic for overhead)  \r\nPrice: $5/year  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=61\"&gt;Order here&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nPackage: Black Friday 2017  \r\nStorage: 100GB  \r\nFeatures: Unlimited domains, unlimited email addresses  \r\nLimitations: None  \r\nPrice: Multiple choice.  \r\n- Monthly: $5  \r\n- Quarterly: $10  \r\n- Semi-annually: $20  \r\n- Annually: $35  \r\n- Biennially: $60  \r\n- Triennially: $90  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=74\"&gt;Order here&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nAlso we have a great announcement that you guys have been asking for: All orders will be provisioned on a server that uses an unbranded hostname. It will not be \"servername.mxroute.com.\" There will be no obvious and clear connection to your hosting provider.\r\n\r\n(Please don't ask us to set up your custom hostnames. If you know how cPanel functions, AutoSSL is running for you to use, but we do not officially support custom hostnames at this time)\r\n\r\nSome features of MXroute:\r\n\r\n- cPanel based front-end\r\n- MailChannels for all outbound email (Never worry about blacklisted IPs again)\r\n- Backup relays\r\n- POP/SMTP/IMAP Supported\r\n- Push email on iOS supported\r\n"}
