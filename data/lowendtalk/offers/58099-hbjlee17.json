We have locations in Toronto and Montreal, providing reliable virtual private server hosting using the KVM hypervisor and the OpenStack software suite.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;E-mail Hosting&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nWe've recently rolled out hosted e-mail services, allowing you to easily send and receive e-mail on your domains. This is available from the E-mail sidebar tab in the control panel. The pricing is simple:\r\n\r\n* $0.2/mo per GB storage\r\n* $0.1 per 1,000 e-mails sent\r\n\r\nThe first 5,000 e-mails sent each month and the first 1 GB of storage used is free (accounting per-client, not per-domain), assuming that you spend at least $3 of credit during the month on other services.\r\n\r\nWeb-mail is available via Roundcube, or you can connect your desktop mail client with IMAPS/SMTPS. You can add user accounts, aliases (which can forward e-mail to one or more recipients, either on the same domain or external), and configure DKIM from the panel. E-mail is replicated across two locations for availability, and backups are taken regularly for data integrity (this is included in the storage price).\r\n\r\nWe're continuing to revamp our non-core feature suite, and there'll be some significant improvements to DNS and monitoring infrastructure in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Pricing&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nAll plans come with a 1gbps network port, unmetered internal traffic, KVM virtualization (with support for installation from custom ISO's), and optional storage on a &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/Volumes\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;distributed Ceph RADOS cluster&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n* 512 MB - 1 vCPU, 15 GB storage, 1000 GB bandwidth, $0.005 hourly ($3.6 monthly)\r\n* 1024 MB - 2 vCPU, 20 GB storage, 1500 GB bandwidth, $0.0072 hourly ($5.18 monthly)\r\n* Special 2048 - 2 vCPU, 20 GB storage, 2000 GB bandwidth, $0.0097 hourly ($7.00 monthly)\r\n* Special 1536 - 1 vCPU, 15 GB storage, 2000 GB bandwidth, $0.0072 hourly ($5.18 monthly)\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://dynamic.lunanode.com/plans.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;See full plan list here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Features&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nWe offer a rich set of cloud features to fit your needs, no matter the application.\r\n\r\n* &lt;b&gt;Hourly billing&lt;/b&gt;: create and destroy virtual machines at any time, and only pay for the hours used. Our service is prepaid, and payments can be made via Paypal or Bitcoin.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;Custom operating systems&lt;/b&gt;: add custom ISO and qcow2 images directly from the panel by submitting a URL to the image; once the panel has finished downloading your image, you can begin provisioning VMs from it immediately.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/Snapshots\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Live snapshots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: snapshot your running VM at any time (no need to even turn it off!). The disk state will then be saved on a distributed filesystem, and can be cloned to provision more instances with the same configuration, or simply kept as a backup.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/API\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: a powerful API is available to programatically manage your servers and other cloud services.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/Virtual_networks\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Private virtual networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: isolate your network traffic and get more control over your network configuration.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/Virtual_networks\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Load balancers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: HTTP(S) and TCP load balancers can be created within virtual networks to easily set up a distributed and redundant service.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/Volumes\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Detachable volumes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: create arbitrary-sized block devices (volumes) and attach/detach them to virtual machine instances on the fly. Volumes are stored on a reliable, distributed Ceph RADOS cluster.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/Security_groups\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Security groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: define external traffic restrictions on a VM-group level to make securing your software easy.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lunanode.com/index.php/Startup_scripts\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Startup scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: specify shell or cloud-config scripts to be run the first time your new VM instances boot.\r\n* &lt;b&gt;Server monitoring and DNS hosting&lt;/b&gt;: we offer complementary server monitoring (with various checks such as ping, TCP connect, and HTTP substring, and alerts over e-mail or SMS) and DNS hosting.\r\n\r\nGet started by &lt;a href=\"https://dynamic.lunanode.com/register.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;registering an account in our panel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!\r\n\r\nYou can open a ticket within the first week to request a refund of remaining credit on your account, no questions asked.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Locations&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nAll standard plans and cloud features are available in both our Toronto and Montreal locations. We feature premium DDoS filtering in Montreal, capable of protecting against large network-level attacks.\r\n\r\n* Toronto location (245 Consumers Rd 300 Toronto; Cogent DC): http://toronto-test.lunanode.com/100MB.test\r\n* Montreal location (OVH BHS): http://montreal-test.lunanode.com/100MB.test\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;About&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nBased in British Columbia, Canada, LunaNode Hosting Inc. first launched in August 2013, focusing on low-cost, reliable KVM virtual private server hosting.
