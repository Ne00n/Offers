If you are looking to have a low latency coast to coast application for the US, we are in a prime location with prime transit!\r\n\r\nAbout Us\r\n\r\nTACServers was formed in 2007 to provide quality service at an exceptional price. We have yet to stray from this mission. We strive to provide the highest level of technical service possible, and will work with you to establish a stable online presence. We own all our own hardware, we do not have outstanding debts, and are here for the long term.\r\n\r\nTACServers bases itself on the pride and ethics we believe is needed to run any type of hosting company. We believe that every server should be maintained at an acceptable load level, and we strive to never oversell our resources. Our OpenVZ nodes are under-allocated, leaving 10-14GB of RAM for caching the FS, and thus, VPS files. Our KVM VPS's allow migration between our multiple nodes. Our team is based out of the United States and have years of networking and Linux/Windows experience!\r\n\r\nTACServers' goal is to make you, the customer, happy. We are proud to call all our customers business partners. Our mission statement: Anything we can do to make you happy, makes us happy!
