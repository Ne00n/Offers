I have confirmed with them that the license could be resold.\r\n\r\nI am thinking to sub-lease the license for $7/month, rather than leaving it idle.\r\n\r\nLicense has to be used within EZPZhosting network, so I will include the following shared hosting package:\r\n\r\nDisk Space: 3GB  \r\nBandwidth: 50GB  \r\nHost unlimited domains  \r\nUnlimited databases  \r\nCloudLinux  \r\nR1Soft daily backup  \r\nSoftaculous\r\n\r\nLocation: Dallas, TX (Internap DAL006)  \r\nRules: generally follow EZPZ TOS &amp; AUP\r\n\r\nComodo Positive SSL is free but you must purchase dedicated IP ($3/month) to use it.\r\n\r\nYou could use it for your project, or just for development purposes. PM me if interested.  \r\nPricing and everything else are negotiable. Let me know what you have in mind. \r\n\r\nThanks all!"}
