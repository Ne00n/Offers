Anyway, here's my offer for the Pure-SSD OpenVZ plans we're currently doing.\r\n\r\n**About us: \r\nSwiftVM** is a brand new venture set out by two linux enthusiasts, one who works generally in the background, and the other who works on the front, providing customer service and finding the next big break through. \r\nWe got our first node on the 1st March 2013 with AIS and ran a few benchmarks, instantly, we saw a major performance ratio and decided that this was the server for us. \r\n\r\nWe asked five LET'ers to test our node, so far, no complaints. And read/write speeds of over 1GBPS. (?!). \r\n\r\nAnyway, we're here to stay, providing a great, friendly experience to all clients and giving them the best possible resources for the lowest possible price. \r\n\r\n**Node Specifications:**\r\nE3-1270v2 \r\n4x 512 Samsung 840 Pro's in RAID 10 (Hardware Raid)\r\n32GB DDR3 ECC Memory\r\n100Mbits from node to switch. \r\nIPv4 / IPv6(coming soon). \r\n\r\n**The Offer(s)**\r\nIn relation to the LET rulings of offers under $7. We're providing a \"10\" use code to be used to knock a generous 15% off any price for life. That makes the following offers LET Compatible. \r\n\r\n**128MB-SSD**\r\n1 CPU Core\r\n128MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n128MB vSwap\r\n2GB SSD Storage\r\n125GB Premium Traffic\r\n100Mbps Network Speed\r\nPrice: $2.55/quarter with LAUNCH-PARTY\r\nDirect: https://www.swiftvm.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3\r\n\r\n\r\n**256MB-SSD**\r\n1 CPU Core\r\n256MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n256MB vSwap\r\n4GB SSD STorage\r\n250GB Premium Traffic\r\n100Mbps Network Speed\r\nPrice: $2.12/m with LAUNCH-PARTY\r\nDirect: https://www.swiftvm.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=4\r\n\r\n**512MB-SSD**\r\n2 CPU Cores\r\n512MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n512MB vSwap\r\n10GB SSD Storage\r\n500GB Premium Traffic\r\n100Mbps Network Speed\r\nPrice: $4.25/m with LAUNCH-PARTY\r\nDirect: https://www.swiftvm.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5\r\n\r\n**768MB-SSD**\r\n3 CPU Cores\r\n768MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n768MB vSwap\r\n15GB SSD Storage\r\n750GB Premium Traffic\r\n100Mbps Network Speed\r\nPrice: $6.37/m with LAUNCH-PARTY\r\nDirect: https://www.swiftvm.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=6\r\n\r\nYour Discount Code: **LAUNCH-PARTY** (10 Uses) \r\n\r\n**Benchmarks**: \r\nhttp://serverbear.com/benchmark/2013/03/02/zh4RuSIbl8eNt6hV\r\nhttp://serverbear.com/benchmark/2013/03/02/Em8FSaCugu5PCXML\r\n&lt;img src=\"http://gyazo.com/71f97912ee2eb02ae0a5c0daa8461123.png\"/&gt;\r\n\r\n**Test IP / Test Downloads:**\r\nhttp://ping.swiftvm.com/ (216.240.191.3)\r\n\r\n**Additional Info:** \r\n\r\nWe strive to answer all tickets within 2 hours of submission, however this isnt always possible, we also have a toll-free number for you to call through Skype, or in the UK for free.
