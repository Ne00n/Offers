I will then PM you with the details.\r\n\r\nThe OS's you may pick from are as follows:\r\n\r\nCentOS 6\r\nCentOS 5 \r\nCentOS 5 w/cpanel\r\nFedora 17\r\nUbuntu 12.10\r\nWindows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise (provide own license)\r\n\r\nAll are 64 bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test will last at least 24 hours, but for as long as we need to pick out all the bugs.\r\n\r\nThe specs for the KVM test are as follows:\r\n1GB Ram\r\n4 core access\r\n60GB Drive (Raid 10)\r\n1.5TB BW\r\n100Mbps port (Node is 1Gbps)\r\nSolusVM\r\nlocated in Phoenix Arizona\r\n\r\nThe only thing we ask for in return is to post any issues you have or bugs and report them to us :)\r\n\r\nIf it works well for you, please post that as well.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone and hope you enjoy!\r\n"}
