We would love to have the chance to earn your trust and your hosting business. If you are not familiar with HostUS, please visit: https://hostus.us/about.html. We are nearing our FOURTH year in business offering quality hosting services that are friendly to your wallet.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the HostUS customers out there from LowEndTalk. Special thanks to each of you that voted in the recent Top Provider Poll. HostUS came in [2nd place](https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/75079/provider-poll-results)!!!\r\n\r\nToday we are launching new OpenVZ services in **Singapore** ([our 8th location globally](https://hostus.us/network.html)). Customers asked for the location, and LET members wanted options in Singapore, so here we are.\r\n\r\nSingapore is backed by Dual Xeon E5 CPUs, RAID 10 SSDs, a good gigabit speed network with local / regional peering, and the service level that differentiates HostUS from the run-of-the-mill hosting company. Learn more about our Singapore location [here](https://hostus.us/singapore-datacenter.html).\r\n\r\nPerformance + Reliability + Support = &lt;u&gt;HostUS&lt;/u&gt;\r\n\r\n**Singapore Launch Promos**\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\nPricing for the new Singapore location is at the same rates we offer services in Hong Kong and Sydney.\r\n\r\nYes, hosting and VPS services cost more in Asia. Our pricing is aggressive while remaining\r\nsustainable as a business. This is why we are still here and growing and other companies are\r\nlong forgotten.\r\n\r\n**SINGAPORE Special - 256MB**\r\n\r\n    256MB RAM and vSwap\r\n    1 vCPU Core (Fair Share)\r\n    10GB SSD Disk Space\r\n    500GB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    4x IPv6 addresses\r\n    OpenVZ / Breeze Control Panel\r\n    $2.95/month\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=183&amp;configoption[47]=261)\r\n\r\n**SINGAPORE Special - 512MB**\r\n\r\n    512MB RAM and vSwap\r\n    1 vCPU Core (Fair Share)\r\n    15GB SSD Disk Space\r\n    750GB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    4x IPv6 addresses\r\n    OpenVZ / Breeze Control Panel\r\n    $3.75/month\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=179&amp;configoption[47]=261)\r\n\r\n**SINGAPORE Special - 768MB**\r\n\r\n    768MB RAM and vSwap\r\n    2 vCPU Cores (Fair Share)\r\n    30GB SSD Disk Space\r\n    2TB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    4x IPv6 addresses\r\n    OpenVZ / Breeze Control Panel\r\n    $5.65/month\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=180&amp;configoption[47]=261)\r\n\r\n**SINGAPORE Special - 1GB**\r\n\r\n    1GB RAM and vSwap\r\n    4 vCPU Cores (Fair Share)\r\n    50GB SSD Disk Space\r\n    3TB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps\r\n    1x IPv4 address\r\n    4x IPv6 addresses\r\n    OpenVZ / Breeze Control Panel\r\n    $6.45/month\r\n\r\n[Order Now](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=181&amp;configoption[47]=261)\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**Available Addons**\r\n\r\nHostUS is now a cPanel NOC partner and WHMCS partner.
