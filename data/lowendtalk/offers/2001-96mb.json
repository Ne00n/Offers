Windows license purchased separately.\r\n[*] 4 Cores Fair use[*] 35 GB Disk Space [*] 1000 GB Bandwidth Transfer[*] 1 IP Address ($2 additional IP)\r\n\r\nThey increased the hard drive space to 45GB for me as well.\r\n\r\nRecurring Amount:\r\n$11.00 USD\r\n\r\nNext Due Date:\r\n04/01/2012\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, they are no longer offering Xen HVM servers for auctions and the standard price they charge is 69.95USD per month.\r\n\r\nI will charge a small token for the transfer fee, please PM me for details.\r\n\r\nNote I have not checked with Kiloserve whether it would be possible for me to transfer this VPS, if not,  I will delete this post or post something else here (have a few that I am not using).\r\n\r\nIf it is not sold before Apr 1, I will cancel it then and Kiloserve may be able to put in another auction for it."}
