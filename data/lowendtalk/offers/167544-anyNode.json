We want to be able to offer our clients features that SolusVM has restricted us from being able to offer, use of SSH keys was a key feature missing and we have many more including BGP, backups and snapshots coming in the near future. \r\n\r\nThe new panel is called Dahlia. Dahlias are a beautiful flower and is also the national flower of Mexico.\r\n\r\nBGP support is currently in closed beta. Please open a support ticket if you'd like to take part!\r\n\r\n##DirectAdmin is also available with all plans! Please open a ticket with sales!\r\n\r\n### We've redesigned all of our plans! These plans are currently limited to Las Vegas with Miami in the not too distant future!\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nKVM NewGen 1GB\r\n1x Shared vCPU Core\r\n20 GB SSD Storage\r\n1 GB RAM\r\n2TB Monthly Bandwidth\r\n1Gbit Public Network Port\r\n1 Dedicated IPv4 Address\r\n/48 IPv6 Subnet\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\nLocation: Las Vegas\r\nONLY $15/Yearly\r\n\r\nOrder here!: [https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=212](https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=212 \"https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=212\")\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nKVM NewGen 2GB\r\n1x Shared vCPU Core\r\n40 GB SSD Storage\r\n2 GB RAM\r\n4TB Monthly Bandwidth\r\n1Gbit Public Network Port\r\n1 Dedicated IPv4 Address\r\n/48 IPv6 Subnet\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\nLocation: Las Vegas\r\nONLY $28/Yearly\r\n\r\nOrder here!: [https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=213](https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=213 \"https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=213\")\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nKVM NewGen 4GB\r\n2x Shared vCPU Cores\r\n80 GB SSD Storage\r\n4 GB RAM\r\n8TB Monthly Bandwidth\r\n1Gbit Public Network Port\r\n1 Dedicated IPv4 Address\r\n/48 IPv6 Subnet\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\nLocation: Las Vegas\r\nONLY $5.50/Monthly $55/Yearly\r\n\r\nOrder here!: [https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=214](https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=214 \"https://billing.anynode.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=214\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPayPal, Credit Card &amp; Credit orders are manually verified by a member of staff to ensure details match both the billing portal and payment processor.
