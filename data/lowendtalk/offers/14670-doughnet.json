I also have colocation with it @ Oplink.net colocation (Dallas). It is currently running on the cheaper plan $41.95 / month for 100mbit up/down unmetered (1AMP/1U space). I confirmed with Oplink that you can take ownership of my hardware &amp; colo as well. I'd do a full re-install of your choice OS.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for offers at the moment, since I am aware that this is an older system/cpu, but it definitely works &amp; performs great. The SSD drive (for OS) greatly improves performance and the other 2 drives are good for storage (how I used it).\r\n\r\nHope everyone have a great rest of the day &amp; thanks for reading my thread!"}
