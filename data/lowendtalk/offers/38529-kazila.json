We operate out of Dallas, TX and offer both virtual and dedicated server hosting solutions.\r\n\r\nWe've just restocked, adding some more pure SSD Xen-based virtual machines in Dallas, TX. We sold out completely on the last offer. We're still offering double the specs (RAM, CPU, disk space, bandwidth) on these packages at no extra cost. These nodes are running the latest processors and technology. These Xen VM's are very fast/responsive and the network is extremely reliable. We guarantee 100% satisfaction or your money back. \r\n\r\n**KSSD-256**&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;256 MB &lt;/del&gt; 512 MB RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;1 &lt;/del&gt; 2 CPU Core&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;5 GB &lt;/del&gt; 10 GB Pure SSD&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;250 GB &lt;/del&gt; 500 GB Bandwidth&lt;br&gt;\r\n1Gbps Port&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 x 1 IPv4&lt;br&gt;\r\nXen PV&lt;br&gt;\r\nDallas, TX USA&lt;br&gt;\r\n**$5/month**\r\n\r\nhttps://www.kazila.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=95\r\n\r\n**KSSD-512**&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;512 MB &lt;/del&gt; 1024 MB RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;2&lt;/del&gt; 4 CPU Core&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;10 GB&lt;/del&gt; 20 GB Pure SSD&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;del&gt;500 GB&lt;/del&gt; 1000 GB Bandwidth&lt;br&gt;\r\n1Gbps Port&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 x 1 IPv4&lt;br&gt;\r\nXen PV&lt;br&gt;\r\nDallas, TX USA&lt;br&gt;\r\n**$7/month**\r\n\r\nhttps://www.kazila.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=94\r\n\r\nServer hardware is 100% owned by Kazila and bandwidth is purchased from Incero. Our provisioning system is fully automated, however each order must be approved manually by our billing department.  Our staff does heavy screening on each order. Please do not utilize a free email address or VPN when purchasing and use a valid phone number or your order will be delayed and may not be approved. This process can sometimes take up to a few hours but most orders will be processed within 15-30 minutes. \r\n\r\nTest IP Address: 23.227.166.120\r\n\r\nLooking Glass: http://23.227.166.120/\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, email us: sales@kazila.com"}
