Decided to go for something a little different here, I'm putting up a Server auction :-P (no, im not making this the next eBay, but thought this was something I hadn't seen on here)\r\n\r\nThis server is Excess to my needs now i have upgraded one of my servers to an E3-1240. \r\nProblem is, the server seems to randomly reset at times, sometimes it's fine for a while etc. I'm suspecting it's a small problem (ie, Loose wire) as Chassis Power remains on etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Lets do this. \r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1U Supermicro Chassis\r\nDual Intel Xeon L5420\r\n16GB RAM (DDR2)\r\n2x1TB Hitachi Drives (4 Bay Hotswap)\r\nIPMI\r\nMotherboard: http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon1333/5000V/X7DVL-i.cfm\r\nChassis: http://www.supermicro.com/products/system/1U/6015/SYS-6015V-M3.cfm\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nCurrently Located @ Quadranet LA - In their Storage Area\r\n\r\nIf i remember correctly, Drives are approximately 7-8 months old. \r\nSuit a nice project box, has plenty of guts surprisingly. Just a pain with the Server resetting (more then likely due to vibrations in the racks, wiggling the Wire out of place)\r\n\r\n\r\nStart Price: $7\r\nIncrements: $2 Minimum\r\nBIN Price: $120\r\n\r\nEnd Time: Tuesday 10th Feb 2015 9am EST (NYC, NY)  ( [TIME CLOCK](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150210T09&amp;p0=179&amp;msg=L5420+Server+Auction&amp;csz=1) )\r\nPayment VIA Paypal or Bitpay (Can supply Invoices via WHMCS for this server if requested by Winner)\r\n\r\n**Server Must be Removed within 24 Hours after End of Auction. ** (Can help organise shipping etc)\r\n\r\nApproximate Measurements when Packed for shipping: [Click Here](http://i.evoburst.com/0208101809-68mp7.png)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRyan B\r\n"}
