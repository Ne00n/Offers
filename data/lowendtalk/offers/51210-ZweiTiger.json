Not tested the ddos protection , but working like cloudflare.\r\n\r\nYou got an IP point to it , then actually active and the traffic cross like at cloudflare. Tested the speed , not bad not bad. So actually cant see any speed decrease , sometimes yes but very low. I suggest you to use as until its free. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think guys :)?\r\n\r\nWell actually its protect up to 20gbps. Saw it on the forum.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nhttp://www.litespeedtech.com/products/anti-ddos-proxy-service\r\n\r\nhttps://store.litespeedtech.com/antiddos/cart.php"}
