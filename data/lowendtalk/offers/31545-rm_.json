They don't list it on the website anymore but it's the 9.99 EUR plan:\r\n\r\n* http://web.archive.org/web/20140122130634/http://www.ovh.com/fr/vps/vps-low-latency.xml\r\n\r\nIt's paid through 26 January 2015, so more than 6 months remaining. Even though the product is discontinued for new orders, it looks like it should be possible to renew it after that date.\r\n\r\nTUN/TAP enabled. rDNS can be changed via panel for IPv4, but not for IPv6.\r\n\r\nTest IPs:  \r\n103.5.12.1  \r\n2402:1f00:2001:100::9\r\n\r\nAsking for 60 EUR in Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin at exchange rate agreed on payment.\r\n\r\nLooks like I **can** transfer it to another OVH (not KS or SYS) account, the OVH support was shockingly helpful and provided me with a full walk-through _in screenshots_ on how to do that. However whether it'll actually work, remains to be seen. Full refund if it the transfer fails, of course."}
