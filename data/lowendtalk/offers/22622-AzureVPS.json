Write caching is planned. Dirty cache random read IOPs was measured to be [~25K with 4kB blocks, or ~100MB/s](http://pastebin.com/khE3K1qP). CPU and network bandwidth is shared across all VPSs on the node with a fair share policy.\r\n\r\nThe AUP in a nutshell is: Nothing illegal. Nothing constantly resource intensive; Disruptive CPU or network usage will have those resources throttled respectively. IRC, game servers and adult content are allowed.\r\n\r\nWe will reply to all support tickets within 24 hours and strive to provide a pleasant experience as possible.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://azurevps.com/ &lt;br /&gt;\r\nNetwork test files: [10MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/10mb.bin) | [100MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/100mb.bin) &lt;br /&gt;\r\nNetwork test IPs: 107.155.70.194 | 2604:880:1:2::2"}
