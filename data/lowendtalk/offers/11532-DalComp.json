Half a month to go then you can continue for $2/month.\r\n\r\nI used it only for storage, so I didn't test much of its performance. &lt;br&gt;Letting go because I need bigger space and now moving to Backupsy.\r\n\r\nAnyone interested just let me know and we'll arrange a transfer. If no one wants it then I'll just let it expire."}
