I have a handful of dedicated servers that I have for no real reason other than \"just because\".\r\n\r\nIf you need cPanel based web hosting, a VPS (I'm running ESXi on the host of all of them), or even something as simple as a Mumble server, feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nI'm not really looking to profit from this or anything else.  Basically just put to use the resources I have to spare.  I'd like to get a couple dollars a month per person, depending on your needs.\r\n\r\nIf you have an interesting project I may even toss something your way for free simply to support it!\r\n\r\nThe servers that I have are all located in the US.  The ones I intend to provision this stuff on are in Dallas and LA."}
