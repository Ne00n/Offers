From our locations in Seattle, Washington and Dallas, Texas we operate redundant premium networks with Cisco Nexus 10Gb switching and Juniper edge routing.  We operate our own network with multiple 10Gb/s uplinks to our providers (Telia, Wave, Cogent, Hurricane Electric, and direct peering in Seattle with Google, Amazon, TELUS, Dropbox, Google and others.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**What makes IonSwitch different?** Many hosts come and go.  Know that we are here for the long haul.  We own each of our servers, network, and rack space to ensure the highest level of availability.  We answer our own support cases, and are on the LowEndTalk Discord anytime you need us.\r\n\r\nOur hosts aren't oversold, and we dedicate 1/2 cpu thread to vcore sold and never more.  We then allow burst and monitor.  Proof is in the pudding, as they say --\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XJIh5Dq.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHypervisor Specs:\r\n\r\n2x Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPU+\r\n128GB RAM\r\n6x 500GB Samsung SSD (700-800mb/s) or 2 x 1TB Samsung NVME\r\nRAID10\r\nRedundant/Diverse 10Gbps uplink\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNETWORK INFORMATION:\r\nSabey Intergate West - Seattle, WA, United States\r\nLooking glass: http://lg.sea.ionswitch.com/\r\n\r\nCarrier 1 - Dallas, TX, United States\r\nLooking glass: http://lg.dal.ionswitch.com/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**OFFERS**\r\n\r\n20% off for the month of February with code **LET-2020-FEB** and **double disk space** (just open a ticket) for any offer.  \r\n\r\n**Cheap VPS**\r\nOur classic VPS512 (512MB ram, 5GB disk) is $14.00/yr in [Dallas](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=36) or [Seattle](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=6) after discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n* 1GB RAM\r\n* 1x vCPU\r\n* 10GB SSD space\r\n* 1TB transfer\r\n* 1000Mbps uplink\r\n* 1x IPv4\r\n* /64 IPv6\r\n* KVM/Virtualizor\r\n* $3.50/month  (take 20% off with coupon!)\r\n* $35.00/year (2 Months Free)  (take 20% off with coupon!)\r\n\r\n[Seattle](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=1) or [Dallas](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=2)\r\n\r\n* 2GB RAM\r\n* 2x vCPU\r\n* 25GB SSD space\r\n* 2TB transfer\r\n* 1000Mbps uplink\r\n* 1x IPv4\r\n* /64 IPv6\r\n* KVM/Virtualizor\r\n* $7.00/month (take 20% off with coupon!)\r\n* $70.00/year (2 Months Free) (take 20% off with coupon!)\r\n\r\n[Seattle](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=3) or [Dallas](https://clients.ionswitch.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=4)"}
