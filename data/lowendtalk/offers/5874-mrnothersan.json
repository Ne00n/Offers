It is colocated in the Host-IT DC in Milton Keynes. It is a Tier 3 (with parts of tier 4) DC.\r\n\r\nOptions for purchase\r\n1) You keep the co-lo contract with Host-IT and pay the amount of about \u00a335 per month + \u00a325-30 for the server rent to me which totals \u00a360-65 per month in total.\r\n\r\n2) You purchase the server from me, and just pay the co-lo contract to Host-IT. In July, when the contract ends, the server would become yours and you would be able to cancel the contract and pull the server from the DC, or carry the contract on.\r\n\r\n500GB Bandwidth, 0.5A power, 10Mbit port (upgrade to 100Mbit free), chargable remote hands depending on time, installs via KVM\r\n\r\nI hope this details things. This is the last time I will be listing this.\r\n\r\nThanks"}
