We're different than the rest, we use VirtKick so can't do all the useless stuff other hosts promise (Alas, no features to break and cause downtime, RIGHT!)\r\n\r\nBacked by OVH, because colocation scares me, too many hardware stealing bastards around. This is a bonus though, you can see exactly what our hosts are packing, AND you know what the DDoS backend can do, so.. If you need protection, forget a sammie bag and come to the fully flavored and ultra thin (For maximum feels) party that is OVH Game Range DDoS mitigation.\r\n\r\nAlso, we don't oversell by a ridiculous amount, only 16VM's per host AND our load stats are public..
