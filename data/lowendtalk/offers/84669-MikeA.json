Our KVM are more expensive, but OpenVZ are considered budget prices and utilize OVH Game DDoS mitigation, which is known to work well against the majority of attacks with minimal drops for game and VoIP. You can request custom network firewall rules to be assigned for your IPv4. If you're interested check out our LET plans below. We take weekly backups of all OpenVZ VPS, and have multiple resource monitoring setup for our systems. We also support IPv6 and include it with every server.  \r\n  \r\nIf you have a question just submit a ticket, typical response time during North America daytime hours is under 10 minutes.
