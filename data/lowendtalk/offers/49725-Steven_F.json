To pay via a non-PayPal method, please open a support ticket.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Where are your dedicated servers located?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAll of our dedicated servers are located in Los Angeles, California at the premium 530 W 6th Street data center. You can ping our website to test out our network. We are in the process of looking into the launch of an east coast facility.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Are you a reseller?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;No! &lt;/b&gt;We own all of our hardware! We do not lease, rent, or resell.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Do you offer DDoS mitigation?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAt this point in time, we do not offer DDoS mitigation. If a DDoS attack is detected which affects the network, we will be forced to temporarily null route your server. Additional DDoS protection may be available as an add-on in the near future. Let us know if you would be interested in it!\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Where are your support technicians located?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAll members of the DediCube technical support team have at least a high school diploma and 2+ years of experience in the hosting industry. We have technicians in the United States of America and Australia, to provide true 24x7 coverage.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Can you provide support in any other language?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nDediCube only provides technical support in English. Sales assistance can be provided via native Chinese (Mandarin) speakers.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;What is enterprise/server grade hardware?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nEnterprise/server grade hardware is hardware which is designed to run under consistent, 24x7 heavy loads. Desktop grade hardware is designed to be used eight hours a day, five days a week (8x5). Many budget dedicated server providers use desktop grade hardware to save money. Not DediCube! All hardware we use is designed for tough usage.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Do you provide any management for these servers?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAll of these servers are self-managed. That means you, the client, are responsible for managing and maintaining all of the software on the server. We are responsible for making sure the network is up and available and that your hardware is replaced, should it begin to fail."}
