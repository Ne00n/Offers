We've got a great limited time offer for you.\r\n\r\nThis offer has been made available to you because I've been left with the pricing whilst Sean is busy tinkering with the servers. Initial thoughts were to spend some several hours working out prices or...\r\n...or ...OR just get rid of stock as quickly as possible to free up my day for more productive work.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate news is Sean doesn't yet know and that's why this is the Sean Surprise!\r\n\r\nAs soon as he finds out, the offer will likely be over (or the price will increase - but purchases already placed will not change) as these prices won't actually cover his time :D\r\n\r\nI wish I were joking."}
