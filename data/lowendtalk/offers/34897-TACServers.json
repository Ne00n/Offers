Accept no less than the best. \r\n\r\nAbout Us\r\n\r\nTACServers was formed in 2007 to provide quality service at an exceptional price. We have yet to stray from this mission. We strive to provide the highest level of technical service possible, and will work with you to establish a stable online presence. We own all our own hardware, we do not have outstanding debts, and are here for the long term.\r\n\r\nTACServers bases itself on the pride and ethics we believe is needed to run any type of hosting company. We believe that every server should be maintained at an acceptable load level, and we strive to never oversell our resources. Our OpenVZ nodes are under-allocated, leaving 10-14GB of RAM for caching the FS, and thus, VPS files. Our team is based out of the United States and have years of networking and Linux/Windows experience!\r\n\r\nTACServers' goal is to make you, the customer, happy. We are proud to call all our customers business partners. Our mission statement: Anything we can do to make you happy, makes us happy! We grow as you grow, and without YOU, the client, we would have nothing to do! Many people neglect the importance of the customer, but not TACServers.\r\n\r\nHere's our VPS plans being offered today!\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n256 MB OpenVZ Virtualization,\r\n256 MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n256 MB vSwap\r\n2 vCPU Cores\r\n30 GB RAID Disk Space\r\n150 GB Bandwidth\r\n100 Mbps Port Speed\r\n1 IPv4 Address\r\n2 IPv6 Addresses\r\nSolusVM VPS Control Panel\r\nLocation: Denver, CO\r\nUS Based Support\r\nTemplates: CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu 14.04 (32bit + 64bit versions)\r\n$4.00 per month (Quarterly $10.00) --- $2.00 / $5.00 With Promo TACLET\r\nOrder Here: [OVZ256](https://manage.tacservers.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2)\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n512 MB OpenVZ Virtualization,\r\n512 MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n512 MB vSwap\r\n2 vCPU Cores\r\n40 GB RAID Disk Space\r\n200 GB Bandwidth\r\n100 Mbps Port Speed\r\n1 IPv4 Address\r\n2 IPv6 Addresses\r\nSolusVM VPS Control Panel\r\nLocation: Denver, CO\r\nUS Based Support\r\nTemplates: CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu 14.04 (32bit + 64bit versions)\r\n$7.00 per month (Quarterly $17.00) --- $3.50 / $8.50 With Promo TACLET\r\nOrder Here: [OVZ512](https://manage.tacservers.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3)\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n1 GB OpenVZ Virtualization,\r\n1024 MB Guaranteed RAM\r\n1024 MB vSwap\r\n2 vCPU Cores\r\n60 GB RAID Disk Space\r\n250 GB Bandwidth\r\n100 Mbps Port Speed\r\n1 IPv4 Address\r\n2 IPv6 Addresses\r\nSolusVM VPS Control Panel\r\nLocation: Denver, CO\r\nUS Based Support\r\nTemplates: CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu 14.04 (32bit + 64bit versions)\r\n$10.00 per month (Quarterly $35.00) --- $5.00 / $17.50 With Promo TACLET\r\nOrder Here: [OVZ1024](https://manage.tacservers.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=4)\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nMain Site: http://www.tacservers.net/\r\n\r\nAUP: http://www.tacservers.net/aup.html\r\n\r\nTest, 100Mbit VPS: http://lg.den.tacservers.net/\r\n\r\nTest IPv6: 2001:470:4b:255:1111:1111:5837:a4a1\r\n\r\nTest IPv4: 64.78.145.92\r\n\r\nASN: http://bgp.he.net/AS13649\r\n\r\nPayment Methods: PayPal\r\n\r\nLimited availibility on this Promo code!

We are expanding into Xen and KVM nodes soon, and adding native IPv6. \r\n"}
