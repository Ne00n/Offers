We fully understand this and that is why we don\u2019t ever limit you if you need the extra storage. If you need more resources just open a ticket with why you need more and we will review your account. (Please note that this is not unlimited or unmetered storage and bandwidth. Each account will have a starting limit. We just upgrade accounts if the account is in good standing. If you have any questions about how this works please email myself at matthew@soaringservers.com\r\n\r\nHow fast will my order be processed:\r\n\r\nOrders are typically processed within 10 hours of the order being made. Please note that it may take up to 24 hours to process your order. If you have ordered an account and your account is past the 24 hours please open a support ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick note:\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to use a promo code and it does not work. This means that we have sold out of that promotion. If you need any help at all please feel free to contact myself at matthew@soaringservers.com\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks LET Members.\r\nAgain feel free to contact us if you have any questions at all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
