In that time we have built up a concise team of technicians and customer service representatives who are not only talented, but love what they do!\r\n\r\nOur servers are located throughout the world, as we offer, and have offered such a range of services throughout our businesses lifetime. We have a lot of very happy customers, especially with our recent specialisms in Virtual Private Server hosting, with hundreds of active users on our nodes. Experiencing stable, friendly hosting.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to open a sales ticket - or email sales@123com.org directly. You can also _try_ our live chat system, but we are working as part of the http://groovehq.com/ beta, and as a result, it's being a little temper mental (we are assured it will be fixed ASAP). Though tickets will receive a speedy response.\r\n\r\nI hope you have an amazing day - and thanks for taking the time to look at 123COM!\r\n\r\nThanks :)"}
