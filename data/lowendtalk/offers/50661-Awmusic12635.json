Unlike a standard VPS package, you can split the resources you pay for into as many servers of any size you want.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHave 12GB of RAM? You can create&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;1 x 12GB server with 5IPs&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;3 x 4GB servers with 1 IP each and 2 with 2 IPs&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;1 x 6GB + 2 x 3GB servers&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\nThe combinations are endless&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nYou choose how you want to split up your resources. Upgrade and downgrade them at any time. In the future you will also be able to split them across locations.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTo celebrate our recent launch we are offering 41% off all our VDR plans in Seattle using the promo code: LAUNCH .&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nEach plan does have the ability to set scheduled snapshot backups, however these backups should be not be relied upon in case of emergency.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**VDR Plan:** &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**VDR4** &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;4 Cores&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;4GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;35GB SSD Disk&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;2000GB Bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;5 IPv4&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;IPv6&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n$7 per month recurring&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n[Order](http://subnetlabs.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=23&amp;promocode=LAUNCH) &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nThe promocode Launch also applies to the other VDR plans on our site too, taking 41% off all of them.
