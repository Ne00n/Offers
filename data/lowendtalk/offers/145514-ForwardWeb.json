We take your websites serious, therefore we take our server hardware and network serious. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are our servers located? Formally the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, our servers are located in the most secure data center in the central United States. Our data center is located in the heart of downtown Dallas, TX. It is in a Tier 3+ facility on the same protected power grid as Dallas 911 and the local hospitals. This means our DC is exempt from rolling blackouts that historically have been an occurrence due to the Texas summer heat. Power is sent to the data center from four different substations, requiring all four substations to go offline before power to the building is interrupted. Additionally, the data center is serviced by water feeds from the north and south of the building. If you want your website hosted with Speed, security and redundancy in mind (built for enterprise), yet priced for the small business. Then Forward Web is the company for you."}
