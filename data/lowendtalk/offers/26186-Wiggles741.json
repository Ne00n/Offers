In turn all I ask is that it will be a source game that has a motd in it. I will place a video ad in that MOTD. The MOTD will be able to be customized with rules and such. There will be no branding and you can place your own clans name in the MOTD. There will also be an available FTP and control panel. We can also supply a fast download, if needed. We have a couple examples of MOTDs that we host for people available via PM.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"}
