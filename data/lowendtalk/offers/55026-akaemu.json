I have no time left and have a server id like to sell to re-coup some money, and move on to my next hobby(salt water fish believe it or not).  This was not used for a business, just as a personal server.\r\nI believe the server is still under dell warranty, ill post the numbers in a picture so you can verify. Ill also attach a few pictures that i took before i mailed it off. \r\nI can't really take any thing less then 1100.00 USD for this.  Im also willing to lease to own it to a reputable company only that would continue the colo until to LTO its paid off.  We could work that out via email/pm.\r\n\r\nIt currently sits in Ashburn VA, you can continue colo for 83.00 per month with a 1GBIT port, /28 ipv4, and a /64 ipv6. That price is already haggled down from there asking price, or send it where you want if you buy it outright. Feel free to ask any questions you may have, or if you want a specific command post it.\r\n\r\n1u Dell R320 Single Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1410 0 @ 2.80GHz (750.00)\r\nDual Power Supplys\r\nDell iDrac 7 with ENTERPRISE license(was like additional 300.00 for the card/license)\r\n1x 500GB sata 3\r\n3x 4TB enterprise toshiba drives.
