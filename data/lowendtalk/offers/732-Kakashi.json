At the time we had no more slots left on our EU Host. I am happy to say we now have a new host available in the UK with plenty of room. It's pretty much empty.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can get for your $7.\r\n\r\n-&gt; **40GB Raid 10 Storage**\r\n-&gt; **512MB Dedicated RAM**\r\n-&gt; **2 CPU Cores**\r\n-&gt; **1TB Bandwidth on a 100mbit connection.**\r\n-&gt; **VMware Web Control Panel Access.**\r\n-&gt; **Complimentary weekly backups.**\r\n\r\n[https://corgitech.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=10](https://corgitech.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=10) and use code : **CORGI50**\r\n\r\n**The above code works with all of our offers and will expire on the 27th of November (2 days from now)**. After that point we will halve the amount of resources and continue to offer it at $7 to maintain presence here. We may choose to extend the offer a bit more on our EU VPS nodes since they weren't available for a while.\r\n\r\nWe have a few customers here on Lowendbox who I am sure will vouch for our support and quality of service.\r\n\r\nTest IP and files for both locations can be found at the bottom of our VPS page : [corgitech.com/linux_vps.html](http://www.corgitech.com/linux_vps.html)\r\n\r\n_We only have IPv4 available at the moment. Domain Name registration, Cpanel and Management options are exlcuded from the offer. IRC , Anonymous Proxies, Medium to Heavy Video Encoding, Seedboxes etc... are not permitted._"}
