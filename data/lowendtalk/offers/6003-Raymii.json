Will be using duplicity to make backups, so ssh access is prefered, but rsync or ftp would also work. \r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n- Around 60GB of storage, might grow\r\n- RAID not needed\r\n- Location is important, should be NL, DE, BE or FR\r\n- Cost preferably under EUR 7/month\r\n- No root access needed, ssh/rsync will be enough\r\n\r\nAny providers willing to make an offer? It will be used and mentioned in a coming article/tutorial about duplicity on https://raymii.org.\r\n\r\nbtw, I know the storage vps question is asked every week, but this is a direct offer question with clear requirements."}
