It's our 6th month on selling VPS's, and we are releasing our limited stock at an extremely low price. **IT IS FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE; _LIMITED QUANTITIES_.**\r\n\r\nWhy choose OpenVZ w/ AsuraHosting?\r\nOpenVZ as opposed to Xen, has less overhead and works more efficient. The memory management is not as in tune as it is in Xen; however, if you are not using/running mainly JAVA-based applications, then OpenVZ is perfect for you. AsuraHosting guarantees your resources and never oversells. You will always be able to use up all your memory, disk space, bandwidth as stated with your package.\r\n\r\nNow for the offers... if you'd like to know more about us, please check out https://asurahosting.com/\r\n\r\n**OVZ VPS-256** (PROMO CODE: **ASURA50OFF**)\r\n256MB Dedicated DDR3 RAM\r\n512MB Burst RAM\r\n10GB Disk Space\r\n250GB Bandwidth\r\n100mbit Port Speed\r\n2 CPU Cores (6Ghz)*\r\n1 IPv4 dedicated address\r\nLocated in Kansas City, MO.\r\nUnmanaged Service\r\nPriced at **$2/month** - [Order Now](https://asurahosting.com/index.php?/cart/virtual-private-server/)\r\n\r\n**OVZ VPS-512** (PROMO CODE: **ASURA50OFF**)\r\n512MB Dedicated DDR3 RAM\r\n512MB vSwap RAM\r\n20GB Disk Space\r\n375GB Bandwidth\r\n100mbit Port Speed\r\n2 CPU Cores (6Ghz)*\r\n1 IPv4 dedicated address\r\nLocated in Kansas City, MO.\r\nUnmanaged Service\r\nPriced at **$3.50/month** - [Order Now](https://asurahosting.com/index.php?/cart/virtual-private-server/)\r\n\r\n**OVZ VPS-1024** (PROMO CODE: **ASURA50OFF**)\r\n1024MB Dedicated DDR3 RAM\r\n1024MB vSwap RAM\r\n30GB Disk Space\r\n500GB Bandwidth\r\n100mbit Port Speed\r\n3 CPU Cores (9Ghz)*\r\n1 IPv4 dedicated address\r\nLocated in Kansas City, MO.\r\nUnmanaged Service\r\nPriced at **$6/month** - [Order Now](https://asurahosting.com/index.php?/cart/virtual-private-server/)\r\n\r\nTest IP: 173.208.225.66\r\nOur Pingdom: http://network.asurahosting.com\r\nOur Facebook: http://facebook.com/AsuraHosting\r\nOur Forum: http://asurahosting.com/forum/\r\nOur IRC: https://asurahosting.com/contact_irc.php\r\nOur E-mail: support@asurahosting.com\r\n\r\nAsuraHosting is currently celebrating it's 6th month anniversary, this company is a partnership between Latheesan Kanesamoorthy and Edward Leung.
