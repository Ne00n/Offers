No sub-users or actual reselling. I would use this account both for production servers and for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nThese are the details of what I'm looking for:\r\n- KVM or Xen\r\n- IPv6 is a MUST\r\n- 2x IPv4 (the other machines would be IPv6 only, these are just for 2 production machines)\r\n- &gt;= 1GB of RAM\r\n- &gt;= 40GB of disk space\r\n- USA (I'm in contact with somebody in Europe about this already): preferably Atlanta, NYC or New Jersey. **NO COLOCROSSING**\r\n\r\nAs to my budget. It's needless to say it depends on what is being offered, but I am looking for something around $15-$20/month.\r\n\r\nThanks everybody in advance for your time and offers :-)"}
