Would that be ok? Since you offered \"unlimited\" bandwidth.\" - mikho*\r\n\r\nWe understand that there may be some confusion about our \"unlimited\" bandwidth policy. Obviously, we cannot offer \"truly\" unlimited bandwidth (or anything else, really!) - no one can. Our policy is simple: your shared hosting account is intended for hosting websites, not for hosting file sharing services, mirroring the Ubuntu package repositories, backing up your movie collection (legally obtained, of course... ;), or anything else that's designed specifically to consume large amounts of bandwidth (or other resources like CPU or RAM). In practice, this means that as long as you're using the resources for hosting websites, your account will never be suspended for using too much bandwidth, though in exceptional circumstances, we may want to work with you to reduce your resource consumption so that everyone (including you) benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT US\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* **Sales**: [sales@stablebox.com](mailto:sales@stablebox.com)\r\n* **Support**: [support@stablebox.com](mailto:support@stablebox.com)\r\n* **Ticket System**: [https://portal.stablebox.com](https://portal.stablebox.com) (You must login to open a ticket with Support.)\r\n* **Billing System**: [https://portal.stablebox.com](https://portal.stablebox.com)\r\n* **Toll-Free Phone**: 1.800.284.6978\r\n* **Further Contact Details**: [https://www.stablebox.com/contact-us/](https://www.stablebox.com/contact-us/)\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* **About Us**: [https://www.stablebox.com/about/](https://www.stablebox.com/about/)\r\n* **Acceptable Use Policy**: [https://www.stablebox.com/acceptable-use-policy/](https://www.stablebox.com/acceptable-use-policy/)\r\n* **Privacy Policy**: [https://www.stablebox.com/privacy-policy/](https://www.stablebox.com/privacy-policy/)\r\n* **Terms of Service**: [https://www.stablebox.com/terms-of-service/](https://www.stablebox.com/terms-of-service/)\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nABOUT US\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAbout the Stablebox Division\r\n-------\r\nHypernia Corporation ([https://www.hypernia.com](https://www.hypernia.com)) launched the Stablebox brand in early 2012 to specialize in providing enterprise class web hosting, cloud servers and dedicated servers to meet the ever growing needs of both individuals and businesses alike.\r\n\r\nStablebox has grown tremendously since its inception and has quickly become a leader in the web hosting industry.
