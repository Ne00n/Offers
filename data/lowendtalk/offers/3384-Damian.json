We moved into the VPS market in May of 2011 as IPXcore. We started this because we were on a BurstNET node that kept getting oversold, and we were unable to get any form of support. We decided that we could do better.\r\n\r\nAll of our nodes are located at Atjeu Publishing in Phoenix, AZ, and transited through a mix of Cox and Integra/ELI. Many of our Asian and European customers tell us they get great connectivity on this mix.\r\n\r\nWe're running OpenVZ virtualization on our very own Dell and HP Opteron-powered hardware.\r\n\r\n**All nodes are on 100 megabit.** We're no longer running with the 20-megabit-per-connection restriction. If you've tried us in the past and found that our network was slow, try us again.\r\n\r\nThe Offer:\r\n\r\n32mbVPS:\r\n32mb RAM\r\n32mb vSwap (Burst RAM available on request)\r\n2gb disk space\r\n20gb monthly transfer\r\n4 CPU cores\r\n\r\n**$1.50 per quarter**\r\nSign up here: https://ipxcore.com/order/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=46\r\n\r\nTest IP: 68.171.100.2\r\n\r\nAdditional IPv4 addresses available for $1.50 per month apiece.\r\nSpecial:16 IPv4 addresses for $20 per month\r\nWe're working on IPv6.\r\n\r\nNeed ram/disk space/bandwidth?
