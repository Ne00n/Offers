We are using Ceph and all-SSD to provide a true cloud service at LEB price. You can read more about why we think cloud storage is so great here: https://www.binarylane.com.au/cloud\r\n\r\nWe have a bespoke control panel with a wide variety of features, some of the more interesting ones are: - external firewall with web-interface - upload/download disk backups - variety of pre-built distributions or BYO ISO - load-balancer as-a-service - OpenStack Compute API support\r\n\r\nThe Test IP/100MB file is here: http://www.binarylanecustomer.com . We are in NextDC Brisbane; our transit is predominantly AAPT and Vocus.\r\n\r\nIn our last submission, the most popular request here on LEB was PayPal support.
