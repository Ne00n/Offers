RocketVPS is the unmanaged brand of the reputable Knownhost, so you won't go wrong with them. \r\n\r\nThe VPS is rock solid and well performing for the months I used it, and the support is very quick and professional. \r\n\r\nThe 50% off coupon also applies to plan upgrades and cPanel, so you can get any plan at 50% off and cPanel for just $4.25.\r\nThe invoice for November is paid. PM me with your offer if you are interested.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I forgot to mention, it's their $9.99 256mb plan right now.\r\n\r\nFan"}
