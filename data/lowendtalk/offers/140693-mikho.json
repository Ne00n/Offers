When that limit is reached, speed is capped at 5mbps for the remaining month.     \r\n- Support and community over at the [LES forum](https://forum.lowendspirit.com/) being a perfect example of what can be hosted on LowendSpirit servers, the LES forum runs on a little 128mb LES server!            \r\n     \r\nOther uses: proxies, Teamspeak, general dev boxes, VPN etc and plenty more.           \r\nGeneral special rules for LES aside from the standard terms.        \r\n    * No TOR         \r\n    * This is a no refund product.         \r\n    * Support only via the forums.       \r\n    * No BitTorrent      \r\n              \r\nNote: When ordering the bundle you will be presented with a regular single VPS, you complete this order and it will automatically take you to the next location and the next as you need to set the password and hostname for each server.           \r\n     \r\n    \r\n       \r\nHetzner - Falkenstein, Germany        \r\nLooking glass: http://lg-de-fks.mrvm.net/        \r\n     \r\nTelepoint Data Center - Sofia Bulgaria     \r\nLooking glass: http://lg-bg-sof.mrvm.net/    \r\n      \r\nTerraHost - Sandefjord, Norway    \r\nLooking glass: http://lg-no-san.mrvm.net/     \r\n       \r\nIkoula - Reims, France    \r\nLooking glass: http://lg-fr-rhe.mrvm.net     \r\n\r\nNocix - Kansas City, Missouri - USA      \r\nLooking glass: http://lg-us-kck.mrvm.net/       \r\n     \r\nDacentec - Lenoir, North Carolina - USA      \r\nLooking glass: http://lg-us-ler.mrvm.net/\r\n      \r\nEquinix  - Sydney, Australia     \r\nLooking glass: http://lg-au-syd.mrvm.net     "}
