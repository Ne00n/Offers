To make up for it we are now bringing you not one, but three 1GB VPS plans: one is powered by KVM and two are powered by Xen virtualization. All three packages come with 1GB RAM, swap space enabled and various amounts of resources (depending on the plan).\r\nTo make this offer even better, each VPS account comes with our Free Managed DNS Service. You can host up to 500 domains per account and there is not limit for the amount of DNS queries. If you are currently using an expensive DNS hosting service that charges you an arm and a leg for everything and places a limit on the amount of DNS queries that you can have per month then you should definitively switch to us and get your DNS service for free.\r\nAnd to top it all off, we also include hardware DDoS protection (at the network layer) and a 99.9% SLA for every VPS server.\r\n\r\nOur website: http://www.vpsnodebox.com\r\nSupport email: support@vpsnodebox.com\r\nTime in business: over 1 year (started in December 2011 as DrupalCentric.com)\r\n\r\nWe maintain our own Xen software stack (http://repo.vpsnodebox.com) and we run Xen on CentOS 6 along with our own custom Xen kernel.\r\n\r\nFor customers and members of this community, as well as other providers who wish to deploy newer software on CentOS 6 (including our own Xen software stack), please visit our public software repository at http://repo.vpsnodebox.com\r\n\r\n**Our DNS Servers are**:\r\n\r\nkip.ns.vpsnodebox.net - Phoenix, AZ\r\nlyn.ns.vpsnodebox.net - Chicago, IL\r\nben.ns.vpsnodebox.net - Denver, CO\r\ngin.ns.vpsnodebox.net - Munster, DE\r\ndan.ns.vpsnodebox.net - Amsterdam, NL\r\nvic.ns.vpsnodebox.net - New York, NY\r\n\r\n**Our 1GB VPS Plans are**:\r\n\r\n1) **Enterprise KVPS 1024 (KVM)**:\r\nCPU Cores: 2\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 1024MB\r\nSwap Enabled: Yes\r\nStorage Space: 40GB\r\nBandwidth: 1TB\r\nNetwork Speed: 50 Mbit (per VPS)\r\nDedicated IPv4 Addresses: 1\r\nAvailable IPv6 Addresses: Yes\r\nAdvanced Control Panel: Yes\r\n99.9% SLA: Yes\r\nHardware DDoS Protection: Yes\r\nManaged DNS Service: Yes\r\nPrice: $7 / month\r\nCoupon code: **KVM7LET**\r\nDirect order link: https://my.vpsnodebox.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=40\r\nService page link: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/enterprise-kvm-vps-servers\r\n\r\n2) **Enterprise EXVPS 1024 (Xen)**:\r\nCPU Cores: 6\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 1024MB\r\nSwap Enabled: Yes\r\nStorage Space: 40GB\r\nBandwidth: 1.25TB\r\nNetwork Speed: 100 Mbit (per VPS)\r\nDedicated IPv4 Addresses: 1\r\nAvailable IPv6 Addresses: Yes\r\nAdvanced Control Panel: Yes\r\n99.9% SLA: Yes\r\nHardware DDoS Protection: Yes\r\nManaged DNS Service: Yes\r\nPrice: $7 / month\r\nCoupon code: **XEN7LET**\r\nDirect order link: https://my.vpsnodebox.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=11\r\nService page link: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/enterprise-xen-vps-servers\r\n\r\n3) **Business VPS 1024 (Xen)**:\r\nCPU Cores: 4 (8 Threads)\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 1024MB\r\nSwap Enabled: Yes\r\nStorage Space: 60GB\r\nBandwidth: 640GB\r\nNetwork Speed: 50 Mbit (per VPS)\r\nDedicated IPv4 Addresses: 1\r\nAvailable IPv6 Addresses: Yes\r\nAdvanced Control Panel: Yes\r\n99.9% SLA: Yes\r\nHardware DDoS Protection: Yes\r\nManaged DNS Service: Yes\r\nPrice: $7 / month\r\nCoupon code: **XEN7LET**\r\nDirect order link: https://my.vpsnodebox.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=4\r\nService page link: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/business-xen-vps-servers\r\n\r\nWe update our Xen and KVM templates frequently, as well as our ISO images.

How does your billing work?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A: Our billing system is prorated around the middle of each month. We do this in order to align customer with the first day of each month for their next invoice due date. For instance if you order service before the middle of January then your total at checkout will be less than $7 and your next invoice will be due on February 1st. If your order after the middle of January then you will be billed for the remainder of January and also for February and your next invoice will be due on March 1st.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Q: What is the difference between the Xen Business Package and Xen Enterprise Package?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A: We deploy the Xen Business Package VPS servers on smaller nodes with more storage and less CPU power (Intel Xeon E3), while we deploy the Xen Enterprise Package VPS servers on larger nodes (Intel Xeon E5) with a little bit less storage, more CPU power and faster I/O speeds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Q: Why is there a limit for the network speed? Is this per server or per VPS?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A: The network speed limit is per VPS and we do this in order to avoid network congestion. This way we can ensure that all our customers get a decent amount of network traffic 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Q: Can I deploy IRC or VPN services? What about torrenting?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A: If you wish to deploy IRC or VPN services on our network just open a support ticket to let us know. We will give you our written consent. Torrenting of copyrighted materials or engaging in other illegal activities is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Q: How many IPv4 addresses can I get with my VPS? What about IPv6?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A: Our lowest VPS packages come with 1 IPv4 address, while our higher end VPS packages come with up to 12 IPv4 addresses. Because IPv4 space is limited, you will need to provide a written justificatio (in a support ticket) for each additional IPv4 address that you request over the default addresses that you are assigned. If you need IPv6 please open a support ticket and we will assign your VPS a /64 IPv6 block from Hurricane Electric.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions please don't hesitate to ask.\r\nMarc M. @ VPS Node Box"}
