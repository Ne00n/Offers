I ran back to back compiles this weekend and it never missed a beat. Just a note, I didn't rent a beast of a machine, just the $20/mo one. Communication is key and Matt plus his staff are lightning quick with responses.\r\n\r\n5) http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1086271 (client for 2 years)\r\n6) http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1167685 (client for 2 years)\r\n\r\n&gt; Support Answers Super Fast (almost under 20 mins) never had downtime never had an issue with network nor hardware, staff is super friendly.

The difference is our HPC nodes get priority support, higher resource priorities, and higher SLA, whereas our LEB servers are more budget friendly. Pricing and availability for new LEB servers may change at any time based on our capacity, after ordering you'll be \"locked-in\" to the current price for the life of the server.\r\n\r\nOur LEB servers have 10GigE network interfaces, incredibly fast SSDs, and very powerful processors.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve achieved over 1GB/s of write throughput and 200K IOPS, making these servers ideal for databases, financial modeling, big data analytics, rapid development, and high density mail and web servers.\r\n\r\n* LowEndBox Mu\r\n* 1x 2.60GHz E5-2650v2\r\n* 1GB ECC RAM\r\n* 10GB Enterprise SSD\r\n* Get 5GB FREE backup storage with JARVYS\r\n* Montreal, Canada\r\n* 500GB Bandwidth @ 10Gbps (shared)\r\n* Only $5.95/mo!

To qualify, it\u2019s required that the Terms of Service hasn't been breached and no more than 10% of the bandwidth has been used. Refunds aren't available for hourly billing cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial rules for LEB Servers:\r\n\r\n* Cannot exceed a load of 1.0 for more than 2 hours per 24 hours period or we may throttle it (HPC Nodes don't have this restriction)\r\n* Please be respectful and don't abuse the service\r\n* No torrents\r\n* No VPN (personal VPN is fine, although you're responsible for the traffic)\r\n\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\n\r\nJARVYS - Simple Linux Backups - https://jarvys.io\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re announcing the beta of JARVYS, our newest Linux backup solution designed for developers. An incredibly simple backup solution that only requires you to copy-and-paste a single command to get up and running. \r\n\r\nAt SSD Nodes, we've been providing managed backup services for the last few years. Months ago, a large client of ours called our managed support team at 3AM saying they hired the wrong developer who completely trashed their database and hosed their entire application. They had their own backup system in place and it silently failed to back up, and they had our internal backup solution as a secondary. We were able to get them restored in 5 minutes, if they didn't have our solution in place they would've had to spend weeks fixing what the developer broke.\r\n\r\nBackup systems are typically an afterthought until you lose your data, when it's already too late. JARVYS is designed to be simple, secure, and reliable. It runs off the same infrastructure that our publicly traded clients with $10+ billion in market cap rely on. It's designed to give you peace of mind, so you can focus on building the things you love rather than worrying about losing your data.\r\n\r\nSupercharge your business today with [SSD Nodes](https://www.ssdnodes.com) and [JARVYS](https://jarvys.io)"}
