I've seen people do things with a 32MB VPS that would make your eyes water.\r\n\r\nSure, they knew their stuff and could work it like a master puppeteer and sure, some people would point and laugh but you know, ain't nobody got time for that. Bring out the big guns.\r\n\r\n_\"Dave\"_, I'd hear them say. _\"You gonna show us something impressive on that thing?\"_\r\n_\"No\"_, I'd say, loading up my bloated Ubuntu desktop. _\"I ain't got nuthin to prove to no-one\"_\r\n\r\n_\"We don't sees it like that!\"_, they'd reply, fingers resting lightly on their Lynx browser.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, we'd both ls -la our Apache processes.
