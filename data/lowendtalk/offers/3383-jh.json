My endeavour is simple: to provide a viable alternative hosting solution for anyone who needs a high-performance SSD VPS and Plesk-based shared hosting here in the UK.\r\n\r\nI've created a customised configuration using the latest solid state drives to deliver up to 230K IOPS or around 1.5-2GB/s of disk IO for the most demanding applications. To put that into perspective, that's around 200x faster than a typical hard disk, and around 2-4x faster than a typical solid state drive.\r\n\r\nVPSs are hosted on server-grade hardware with Intel Xeon E3 processors, DDR3 memory and fast, UK bandwidth. I have set up these servers using the KVM virtualisation software to enable full management and keep costs low. Management is via the SolusVM console.\r\n\r\n**256MB RAM\r\n3GB Pure SSD (230K IOPS)\r\n100GB Bandwidth\r\n\u00a34.49/month ($7 USD) with coupon 5O63CUJ1PY\r\n[Order](https://www.killerio.com/billing/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1)**\r\n\r\nTest IP: 91.227.221.121\r\nTest Download: [100MB](http://plesk.killerio.com/100mb.test)\r\nData Centre: Custodian DC in Kent, UK (Level3 Bandwidth!)\r\n\r\nOrders should be set up immediately assuming they pass fraud checks. There are some benchmarks on my [blog](http://www.jhadley.net/blog/?p=47)."}
