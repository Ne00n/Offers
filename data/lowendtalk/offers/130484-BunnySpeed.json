We're giving a 25% recharge bonus with every payment done on November 24th. As thank you for such a positive feedback from the LET community I've also thrown in another promo code just for you guys. The promo code gives you a $5 account credit with no payment required and it expires/extends your balance for up to 3 months. This can be easily extended by making a payment. The code also applies a **20% recurring discount for EU/US traffic on the Premium zones**. (Existing, discounts do not stack, the larger one is applied)\r\n\r\nWe now offer two pricing tiers aimed at different requirements. Both are 100% Pay As You Go with a $10/year minimum payment\r\n\r\n##Premium Tier (23 POPs, any region can also be toggled on/off)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n$0.010/GB for EU/US (-20% with the promo code)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n$0.030/GB for Asia and Oceania&lt;br /&gt;\r\n$0.045/GB for South America&lt;br /&gt;\r\n$0.060/GB for South Africa&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n##Volume Tier (8 POPs)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n$0.005/GB Global rate&lt;br /&gt;\r\nEnabled pops: Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, New York City, London, Frankfurt, Gravelines, Milano&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n##More info&lt;br /&gt;\r\nWhat do we offer?&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- 100% SSD hardware&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- Anycast DNS&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- Free SSL for custom hostnames with Let's Encrypt integration&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- HTTP/2&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- Toggle any region ON/OFF&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- Secure URL tokens&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- HTTP Video delivery&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- &gt;95% Cache HIT rate&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- Instant setup with a super simple control panel&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- Friendly team and a cute name :)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- CDN accelerated cloud storage ($0.01/GB of storage)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- Block IPs, countries\r\n- Hotlinking protection\r\n- 99.99%+ Uptime guarantee&lt;br /&gt;\r\n- And lots more :)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\n**Promo code: LETFRIDAY-2017**&lt;br /&gt;\r\nFor more info, you can have a look at https://bunnycdn.com&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n##Our Network&lt;br /&gt;\r\n**Europe**&lt;br /&gt;\r\nLondon, UK&lt;br /&gt;\r\nGravelines, FR&lt;br /&gt;\r\nFrankfurt, DE&lt;br /&gt;\r\nMilan, IT&lt;br /&gt;\r\nMoscow, RU&lt;br /&gt;\r\nStockholm, SE&lt;br /&gt;\r\nBucharest, RO&lt;br /&gt;\r\nMadrid, ES&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n**United States**&lt;br /&gt;\r\nNew York City, NY&lt;br /&gt;\r\nLos Angeles, LA&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAtlanta, GA&lt;br /&gt;\r\nChicago, IL&lt;br /&gt;\r\nSeattle, WA&lt;br /&gt;\r\nDallas, TX&lt;br /&gt;\r\nSan Jose, CA&lt;br /&gt;\r\nMiami, FL&lt;br /&gt;\r\nKansas City, MO&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n**Asia &amp; Oceania**&lt;br /&gt;\r\nSingapore, SG&lt;br /&gt;\r\nTokyo, JP&lt;br /&gt;\r\nBangalore, IN&lt;br /&gt;\r\nSydney, AU&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n**South America**&lt;br /&gt;\r\nS\u00e3o Paulo, BR&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n**South Africa**&lt;br /&gt;\r\nJohannesburg, GT&lt;br /&gt;"}
