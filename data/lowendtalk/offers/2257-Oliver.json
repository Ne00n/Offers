We had an offer up in February [here](http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/ransomit-7-00m-openvz-512mb-ram-in-australia/) but reached capacity fairly quickly (ran out of IPs and allocatable RAM). We've now deployed a new node and had our IP range expanded so we have the following offer available to LEB'ers:\r\n\r\n**256MB** of Memory, burstable to 512MB\r\nOpenVZ / Solus VM\r\n**2 CPU** cores (shared Xeon E3-1240)\r\n**10GB** of disk space\r\n**20GB** of data transfer\r\n\r\nData is expensive in Australia, but if you are building a DNS cluster or some other service that doesn't push a lot of data around or want a presence here for geographical purposes we can offer a reliable service for you. We took up suggestions after our last LEB offer and made a number of new OS templates available. TUN/TAP can be enabled on request if you want a VPN.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a traceroute use this IP: 119.252.16.253\r\nOur servers are at [Colocity](http://www.colocity.com/). We've had an excellent run here, one of our primary nodes for other services we offer has an uptime of 395 right now and we've not had any outages at all. So while latency might be high for most non Australian users availability will also be excellent.\r\n\r\n[Click here to sign up](http://www.ransomit.com.au/leb_offer) with the promo code \"GDAY LEB\". Please read the page and the TOS (link in the footer) before signing up. Service is payable quarterly via Paypal or Alertpay - $20/quarter.\r\n\r\nCheers and I hope to welcome some of you onboard.\r\n\r\nOliver"}
