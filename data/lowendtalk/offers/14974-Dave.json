Check out the incredible response we received last time!\r\n\r\n* gubbyte - \"No thanks.\"\r\n* Amarielle - \"Is it me or is that the worst advert ever?\"\r\n* CVPS_Chris - \"Haha, site is a joke, restrictions are a joke, and no IPv4 is a joke. No competition here. looks like a 10 year old made it.\"\r\n* AuroraZ - \"I would not touch this with a 100ft. pole.\"\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't convince you, nothing will!\r\n\r\n## Your feedback\r\n\r\nThe feedback we got from most people last time was that we weren't old enough, the advert was atrocious and 'dire' had negative connotations so we're addressing all those concerns.\r\n\r\nNow we're older. Now we're more atrocious and now we're even more Dire-er-rer!\r\n\r\nAll feedback welcome :)"}
