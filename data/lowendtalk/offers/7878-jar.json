What I want you to know is that we're not just a service provider. We are active on Lowendtalk and we're also customers.\r\n\r\nCatalyst Host continues to grow, thanks to our loyal customers. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI'd like to introduce the third member of our staff, Don who is also known as @halfeatenpie. He is a great addition to our team and is also glad to assist you in any way that he can.\r\n\r\nNow for the reason you are reading this, the promo deals!\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Special Offers (limited stock):&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nMicro\r\nLocation: Dallas, Texas, USA\r\n1 CPU Core (E5-2620)\r\n128MB RAM\r\n128MB vSwap\r\n10GB Storage\r\n300GB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps\r\n1 User Generated Backup\r\n$17/year\r\nhttps://catalysthost.com/clientarea/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=44\r\n\r\nTrenta\r\nLocation: Dallas, Texas, USA\r\n4 CPU Cores (E5-2620)\r\n2048MB RAM\r\n512MB vSwap\r\n50GB Storage\r\n1TB Bandwidth @ 1Gbps\r\n1 User Generated Backup\r\n$7/m\r\nhttps://catalysthost.com/clientarea/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=45\r\n\r\nTest IP/File: http://192.211.54.101/100mb.test\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Data backup policy:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nAll data on these plans are backed up weekly in Dallas and stored offsite. Our backups are for emergencies. Your user generated backups are for small issues. We only guarantee access to our offsite backups if we are responsible for data loss. This helps keep our costs reasonable while providing two different layers of backups for your important data.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;About our Dallas datacenter:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe network behind our Dallas servers is multi-homed with multiple 10Gbit connections and redundant Juniper routing with HSRP failover. Network and hardware conditions are monitored 24/7/365. Spare hardware is always stocked and available on site. We utilize A+B power for redundancy in case of brownouts, which are rare in Dallas.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Our hardware is as follows in Dallas:&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nNode5:\r\n1x Xeon E5-2620\r\n64GB ECC Memory\r\n4x 1TB Enterprise SATA\r\nLSI 9260-4i w/BBU &amp; 512MB Cache\r\n\r\nNode6 (Current standard for future nodes):\r\n2x Xeon E5-2620\r\n64GB ECC Memory\r\n8x 500GB Enterprise SATA\r\nLSI 9260-8i w/BBU &amp; 512MB Cache\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What makes Catalyst Host a special company?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you're not going to do something right, don't bother doing it.\r\n\r\nCatalyst Host has been in business since early 2011.\r\n\r\nWe are not here to give you the most imaginary resources you can't use for the least dollar signs. We are here to give you the best quality, with what I estimate to be some of the least oversold nodes in our market. You have the peace of mind that you services are in good hands, that your service will operate as expected, and that your data will remain safe."}
