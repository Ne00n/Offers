We specialize in providing effective DDoS proxy solutions at an affordable rate.\r\n\r\n**The Offer**\r\n\r\nWe are offering 40% off all our US DDoS protection services. I originally planed to offer our EU services at a similar rate but the announcement of our new range is not complete yet, I will do a separate offer for it later. We are attempting to fill new/empty servers with customers, these offerings are at or below cost and never to be repeated. Free trial for US services is still available, however the deposit is not effected by this coupon. The coupon will not follow any plan upgrades or downgrades at a later date.\r\n\r\nI will be restricting the coupon to specific servers as they fill up, so don't delay or you will miss out! This coupon can not be applied to existing services, no exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Prices and Order Links**\r\n&gt; USA OR / LV DDOS (Server 1) \r\n&gt; ================= \r\n&gt; [25GB Starter - $5.40](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=13&amp;plan=1&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [75GB Small - $6.00](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=13&amp;plan=2&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  USA OR / LV DDOS (Server 2)  \r\n&gt; ================= \r\n&gt; [25GB Starter - $5.40](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=7&amp;plan=1&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [75GB Small - $6.00](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=7&amp;plan=2&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Romania \r\n&gt; ================= \r\n&gt; Will be available with a 75%! discount at a later date (possibly Monday)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; USA Chicago\r\n&gt; ================= \r\n&gt; [25GB Starter - $5.40](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=16&amp;plan=1&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [75GB Small - $6.00](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=16&amp;plan=2&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; USA Denver\r\n&gt; ================= \r\n&gt; [25GB Starter - $5.40](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=17&amp;plan=1&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [75GB Small - $6.00](http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices#purchase&amp;server=17&amp;plan=2&amp;tier=4&amp;coupon=BOXEDUP)\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nFull details available on the pricing page: http://www.x4b.net/ddos/prices\r\n\r\n**Be sure to use these links when ordering for the discount to apply.** \r\nIf you need to complete your registration double check that the coupon is still active after registration, if not resume from the link again.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n\r\n- Full support for TCP and UDP port forwards as well as HTTP forwarding with unlimited virtual hosts.\r\n- Every service includes a dedicated IPv4 address\r\n- SSL support (with SPDY)\r\n- Edge caching (with management via web interface)\r\n- [More Features](http://dev.x4b.org/reverse-proxy/prices)\r\n\r\n**GRE**\r\n\r\nWe are currently looking for beta testers for GRE/IPIP tunnels (not currently supported). Testing will take place in July. However does depend on how long it takes for a few provider issues to get resolved. \r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n- Must know how to configure and setup a GRE tunnel. We are looking for skilled people who can find fault in our design.\r\n- Must already have a VPS/Server with tunnels enabled, one will not be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease get in contact if you are interested.
