I can create a custom package on request.     \r\n**2) Do your servers employ Raid?**     \r\n     Yes, all servers are using either using RAID 1 or RAID 10.    \r\n**3) Do you backup individual VPS containers?**     \r\n     No, you are responsible for backups of the data on your VPS. In the event of complete data loss, your container will be re-created as soon as possible.      \r\n**4) Will you help me install/set up X, Y, Z?**       \r\n     This is an unmanaged service, your support options for installs/configurations are posting your questions at the [Lowendspirit ](http://forum.lowendspirit.com) forum or here.      \r\n**5) TUN/TAP available?**     \r\n     Yes, enable/disable it from the WHMS integrated control panel.     \r\n**6) Why does the service list a bandwidth limit when you offer unmetered ports?**       \r\n     When that limit is reached the VPS is not suspended like many other providers do. Your connection will only be limited to a lower (still acceptable) speed.     \r\n     This is a part of the Fair Usage Policy.      \r\n**7) What is this \"Fair Usage Policy\"?**     \r\n     Here on LET it's called \"The Golden Rule\";      \r\n&gt; Don\u2019t be a dick.\r\n&gt; Do unto others. Don't do things that decades of netiquette have shown to be offensive. Don't be That Guy. Don't break the rules. When in doubt, don't.\r\n&gt; Just don't be a dick.\r\n**8) Examples of unacceptable content/applications**\r\n    * TOR\r\n    * Open proxies\r\n    * Port scanning\r\n    * website and/or service in regards to pirated software\r\n    * Public VPN      \r\n    \r\n\r\nNOTE: Breaking the Fair Usage Policy will not get you suspended, it will get you terminated.\r\nIf you have a question about acceptable applications, post it in the [Lowendspirit ](http://forum.lowendspirit.com) forum.\r\n&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Behave&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n"}
