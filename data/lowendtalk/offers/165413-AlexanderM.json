We a big enough to offer a diverse line of services globally, while still being a small business that offers personalized service and human familiarity that are absent in the sea of faceless hosting companies.\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Today\u2019s Offers&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\nToday we are offering KVM VPS services on our brand new AMD Ryzen 9 3900X platforms with\r\nspeedy NVMe storage in RAID 1 for redundancy!\r\n\r\nWith KVM you are able to natively run a wide range of kernels. No more modules to load. No more hacking things together or those tutorials that just don\u2019t work because of the quirkiness of OpenVZ. Everything in KVM works essentially like a bare metal server. You have full selection of the common Linux / BSD OSes, and Windows is available on 2GB+ RAM plans. Upon request we can load any ISO you want to install, and snapshots are available too.\r\n\r\n**Available in Los Angeles, CA ([Looking Glass](https://la-lg.hostus.us/ \"Looking Glass\")) and Dallas, TX ([Looking Glass](http://dal-lg.hostus.us/ \"Looking Glass\"))**\r\n\r\n**512MB RAM: [Just $20/year!](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=400&amp;billingcycle=annually)**\r\n```\r\n512MB RAM\r\n1 CPU Core (Ryzen 3900X)\r\n15GB NVMe Disk Space\r\n1TB Bandwidth\r\nKVM / Breeze Control Panel\r\n```\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n**1GB RAM: [$3/month paid annually ($36/year) or $4/month](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=391&amp;billingcycle=annually)**\r\n```\r\n1GB RAM\r\n1 CPU Core (Ryzen 3900X)\r\n25GB NVMe Disk Space\r\n1TB Bandwidth\r\nKVM / Breeze Control Panel\r\n```\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n**2GB RAM: [$5/month paid annually ($60/year) or $7/month](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=401&amp;billingcycle=annually)**\r\n```\r\n2GB RAM\r\n1 CPU Core (Ryzen 3900X)\r\n40GB NVMe Disk Space\r\n2TB Bandwidth\r\nKVM / Breeze Control Panel\r\n```\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n**3GB RAM: [$7/month paid annually ($84/year)](https://my.hostus.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=402&amp;billingcycle=annually)**\r\n```\r\n3GB RAM\r\n2 CPU Cores (Ryzen 3900X)\r\n70GB NVMe Disk Space\r\n4TB Bandwidth\r\nKVM / Breeze Control Panel\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Need something else?**\r\n\r\nOur popular 768MB OpenVZ annual plan is available for just $16/year.
