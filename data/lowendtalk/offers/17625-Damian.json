Power-on hours for the other half of the drives is 7876 hours / 24 = 328 days.\r\n \r\nAsking $160 plus shipping each, buy all nine and i'll ship them for free within the United States. Willing to do shipping via USPS or UPS, your choice. Cheapest I could find these for new was $244, and used on eBay was $195. Get an enterprise hard drive for the same price as a desktop drive."}
