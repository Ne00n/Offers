Why? Because it's ...\r\n\r\n1. Easy to setup\r\n\r\n- download our client (or use old school GRE) and connect to our network,\r\n\r\n- setup your routing software (like Quagga or ExaBGP) and establish BGP session with us (you can use private ASN which is free of charge),\r\n\r\n- configure your service to use your anycast IP\r\n\r\nThat's all! Believe or not you can add up to 255 backend servers per single anycast IP\r\n\r\n2. Secure - all IPs are DDoS protected in cooperation with Staminus\r\n\r\n3. Cheap - the monthly cost of the service is 25\u20ac/IP with 25GB of traffic included (additional traffic 0.10\u20ac/GB). Additional discounts for multiple IPs and larger IP blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions feel free to drop us mail - office [ at ] gbshouse.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
