Therefore, we are trying to find out what our customers want. For us, it is important to first see how many customers would like to have their own VPS-servers with us. This way, we can always improve our service, because we absolutely want our customers to be satisfied for the full 100 percent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are offering a VPS for EUR 5 per month, in a limited edition. Of course, we are providing as great service as you would need. Because this is a test situation, we do not yet have a hosting division on our website. You could see this as an offside-test to measure the popularity of VPS servers. \r\n\r\n **We are offering**\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n 2 GB RAM\r\n 2 GHz processor\r\n100 GB HDD\r\n100Mbps network speed\r\nLocation: France\r\nGeo-located IP-address: Portugal, Ireland, Czech, Lithuania, Finland, Belgium, Great-Brittain, Germany, Poland, France, Spain, The Netherlands.\r\nLINUX ONLY!\r\nSpam, DDoS and other illegal stuff is not allowed, of course!\r\nNo open proxies\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n5 EUR PM. Payment via Paypal or bank deposit (IBAN). This is a LIMITED offer.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to have more information, just send me a message and I will do my best to provide you the information needed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDennis"}
