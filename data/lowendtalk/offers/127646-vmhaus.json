The latest addition to the Clouvider and VMHaus family. The Clouvider network vastly improves our connectivity in London including direct peering with Liberty Global (Virgin Media, UPC, Aorta and more) with direct and recently upgraded ports to LINX 1 &amp; 2 (which allows us to peer with BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Zen and more!) and up links include the usual (Level3, NTT, GTT, Telia, Cogent)\r\n \r\nWe've also just upgraded our network we now have our own LINX LON1 port allowing us to directly peer with hundreds of members including Sky,Google,Netflix and more.\r\n \r\nThanks to some recent upgrades out Clouvider their network is now locally DDoS protected thanks to our on-site DDoS protection with NTT protection staying on hand for those larger attacks\r\n \r\nAs for our hardware we\u2019ve gone with a brand spanking new Xeon E3-1270 v6 which clocks in at 3.8GHz with a nice little boost to 4.2GHz. We've also added 64GB of ECC DDR4 RAM for good measure finally backed by our 1TB Samsung NVMe disks which give your applications that little push to run faster.\r\n \r\nWe also support IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions.\r\n \r\n Quick Links\r\n   Node Status: http://status.vmhaus.com  \r\n   Bonsai Control Panel: https://bonsai.vmhaus.com  \r\n   Website: https://www.vmhaus.com  \r\n   FAQ: https://www.vmhaus.com/#faq  \r\n   Terms of Service: http://vmhaus.com (Click legal)  \r\n   \r\n \r\nThank You, Your friends at VMHaus\r\n"}
