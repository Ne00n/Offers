This isn't for profit, this is priced to not be a loss and to give back to a great community. We can spare it. The support we've had from LET since we started offering VPS services has been overwhelmingly great. I'm not going to lie, you guys basically made us. Don't think we're not grateful. I wish I could offer a ton of these, but I have to limit it to keep providing the quality service that you've come to expect of us.\r\n\r\nOpenVZ - Tiny - Dallas, TX\r\n1 CPU Core\r\n256mb RAM\r\n256mb vSwap\r\n30GB Storage (HW RAID10)\r\n400GB BW @ 1Gbps\r\n$25/year\r\nOrder: https://catalysthost.com/clientarea/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=36\r\nTest file: http://192.211.54.101/100mb.test\r\n\r\nNode stats:\r\nload average: 0.79, 0.70, 0.73\r\niowait: 0.6%\r\n\r\nFor our other plans, visit https://catalysthost.com/vps.php\r\n\r\nAll plans come with VirtPanel, DNS hosting for one domain, 1 user generated backup, weekly node backups."}
