Therefore I'm hiring someone to do the work instead of doing it myself as a rookie.\r\nBasically I 'just' want a 'cut &amp; paste' of my current server to my new VPS. OS = Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit.\r\n\r\nAside from that, the server is running a MyISAM MySQL (Percona) database. I would like to see this converted to InnoDB so please include this in your price :)\r\n\r\nI prefer a fixed-price job but if that's not possible, please contact me with your hourly rate and an estimate how long it's going to take. If you're interested or need more infos, please let me know."}
