Completely virgin.\r\nI am hoping to rent these ips to VPS providers. \r\nI am getting some interesting mails from so called \"ip investment companies\" offering me around $2.5 for ip.\r\nBut I don't want to hand them to some organized spam operation just for money. \r\nI am open to all suggestions. \r\nPM me if you are interested.\r\n\r\n"}
