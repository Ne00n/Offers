Today is not Black Friday, so our offer can't be soooo bold as our BF deal, but we really hope it is bold enough to \u0441heer you up =)\r\n\r\nHere is a recurring coupon for 50% off for our [Storage VPS plans](https://veesp.com/en/products/storage-vps) on **yearly** payments: **LETSTORAGE50**\r\n\r\nRemember that our yearly prices already include 15% off, so you get **almost 60% discount**! The coupon **works both for new and old customers** with no limit per customer! But the total number of servers is limited, so hurry up)"}
