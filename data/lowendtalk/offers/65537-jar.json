The idea here is to blend low price with quality email hosting for your domain so that you can let me do the hard work for you.\r\n\r\nSome features:\r\n\r\n- Server side filters  \r\n- Webmail (Roundcube, Horde, Squirrelmail)  \r\n- SMTP, POP3, IMAP  \r\n- OwnCloud storage for every email account you create  \r\n- cPanel back end, integrated into WHMCS  \r\n- DNS hosting (requires using cPanel directly)  \r\n- Greylisting  \r\n- Hand-made SpamAssassin filters by yours truly  \r\n\r\nAll of our packages include:\r\n\r\n- Unlimited domains  \r\n- Unlimited email accounts\r\n\r\nThe only limitation based on the packages would be disk space, which is shared among all of the domains/email accounts that you make under that package. You can allocate storage in any way you see fit, the limit is hit only when actual usage reaches the package limit.\r\n\r\nTake 50% off ALL of our packages today with promo code TWOTHOUSAND. We\u2019re still celebrating hosting 2,000 domains, even though we\u2019re a bit beyond it now.\r\n\r\nYearly Packages:\r\n\r\nSmall  \r\n5GB Storage  \r\n$7.50/year with promo code TWOTHOUSAND  \r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=26\r\n\r\nMedium  \r\n10GB Storage  \r\n$10/year with promo code TWOTHOUSAND  \r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=27\r\n\r\nLarge  \r\n15GB Storage  \r\n$12.50/year with promo code TWOTHOUSAND  \r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=28\r\n\r\nMonthly Packages:\r\n\r\nMX1  \r\n20GB Storage  \r\n$2.50/m with promo code TWOTHOUSAND  \r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=34\r\n\r\nMX2  \r\n30GB Storage  \r\n$5/m with promo code TWOTHOUSAND  \r\nhttps://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=35\r\n\r\n(One more package available via website, too high monthly for LET)"}
