While we\u2019re not near the budget line, we\u2019re definitely below market-value for what we\u2019re offering.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re in the SSD VPS lineup, and notably, we offer an optional fully-managed solution by in-house techs who have worked for companies like MediaLayer and JaguarPC. It's based on XEN with some KVM for FreeBSD and Windows. We're also implementing a stack solution that rivals Linode's stack scripts ;)\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019d like to do is offer 10 people a two week trial where they can blow up Solus, our containers, and help us find any kinks in the armor. There is bound to be a bunch of them. For those who are interested and help find the kinks, I\u2019d be glad to throw a 50% lifetime discount your way that you can take advantage of yourself or even give it to someone who can.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, shoot an email to josh[at]whoa.io with who you are, what you do, and why you'd like to screw things up."}
