Besides Linux, I love the whole computer world. I like to code in PHP and also know a little Ruby. Today (6th of June - Somehow this date is related to IPv6 I think) I want to offer you a free VPS as I want to gain more knowledge on administrating Linux servers. You can simply help me by getting a VPS and testing it.\r\nOf course my money is limited so it's only possible that you get a VPS that is reachable over IPv6 - but that's still better than nothing - isn't it?\r\n\r\nhttp://amfy.nerdsein.org/ipv6/ (I go to bed in some minutes, so I think you will get your VPS tomorrow)\r\n\r\nI would be happy for getting some reviews after a couple of tests :)"}
