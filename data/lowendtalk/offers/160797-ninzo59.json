Technically it will be only released tomorrow, it's a pre-sale let's say :)\r\n\r\nIt concerns the whole dedicated server range, for each 6/12 months commitment. \r\n\r\n**End date: 30th October**\r\n\r\n=&gt; Choose \"Bi-annual\" / \"Yearly\" as Payment frequency \r\n\r\nI know some of you wanted flash sale, it will come at some point :)\r\n\r\nFeedbacks are (very) welcome here.\r\n\r\nThanks !"}
