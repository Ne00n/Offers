So for that, I decided to install an IRC bouncer.  Right now, I'm accepting anyone who requests for an account.  I know this topic is not very popular among LET, but it's the only thing I can think of.  If you have any other suggestions in which I can provide a \"service\", please do suggest.  \r\n\r\nThe bouncer is currently running ZNC.  A web control panel is available.  PM if you're interested.
