I don't have the time needed to start the projects they were initially intended for. I'm just looking to get my money back out of them so bidding starts low. All licenses sold to highest bid/offer over asking price in the next 24 hours (bidding ends 11AM EST on 09/27/2014). Please do not PM offers, post all offers in this thread. Please make a note of what you are bidding for to avoid confusion (ex. Blesta: $100)\r\n\r\nBlesta License:\r\nThis is one of the $99 special, owned, unbranded, licenses. 1 year of support and updates will be purchased before transfer. Bidding starts at $120\r\n\r\nHostBill Licenses:\r\nLegacy HostBill owned unbranded license ($299.95 original cost) w/ Developer ($40) and IPAM plugin ($49) licenses. These are getting harder and are near impossible to get with the dev account/license. Bidding starts at $300\r\n\r\nIPS Community Suite, IP.Board, IP.Chat: 5 User:\r\nPurchased in 2013 and never used. Paid $175, needs to be renewed/reactivated. I'll pay the $25 before transfer. Bidding starts at $100\r\n\r\nPAYMENT AND TRANSFER TERMS:\r\nYou will be sent a link via PM to order and pay for these licenses on our site. Payment details must match registered account details. I will open a ticket with license/account transfer details as soon as payment is received. Any disputes and/or charge-backs after transfer will be publicly named and shamed. Sorry for the hoops; I've been burnt in the past."}
