I ran back to back compiles this weekend and it never missed a beat. Just a note, I didn't rent a beast of a machine, just the $20/mo one. Communication is key and Matt plus his staff are lightning quick with responses.\r\n\r\n5) http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1086271 (client for 2 years)\r\n\r\n6) http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1167685 (client for 2 years)\r\n\r\n&gt; Support Answers Super Fast (almost under 20 mins) never had downtime never had an issue with network nor hardware, staff is super friendly.

The difference is our HPC nodes get priority support, higher resource priorities, and higher SLA, whereas our LEB servers are more budget friendly. Pricing and availability for new LEB servers may change at any time based on our capacity, after ordering you'll be \"locked-in\" to the current price for the life of the server.\r\n\r\nOur LEB servers have 10GigE network interfaces, incredibly fast SSDs, and very powerful processors.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve achieved over 1GB/s of write throughput and 200K IOPS, making these servers ideal for databases, financial modeling, big data analytics, rapid development, and high density mail and web servers.\r\n\r\n* LowEndBox Mu\r\n* 1x 2.60GHz E5-2650v2\r\n* 1GB ECC RAM\r\n* 10GB Enterprise SSD\r\n* OpenVZ + SolusVM Control Panel\r\n* 500GB Bandwidth @ 10Gbps (shared)\r\n* Only $5.95/mo! ($48/yr)\r\n* [Get started!](https://www.ssdnodes.com/manage/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=83)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need a larger node (up to 240GB RAM), let us know and we can put together a custom package for you.\r\n\r\nNo-hassle refunds are provided within 7 days of ordering and are limited to monthly and annual billing cycles only.
