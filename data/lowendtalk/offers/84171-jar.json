As the service grows in offerings I expect to have less opportunities to offer such great promotions. It is also possible that the service will see a base price increase by the end of this year. With that said, prices are never raised for existing services.\r\n\r\nI invite you all to get in on my latest promo, one that can serve you well for years to come with a very generous amount of storage.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;THIS PROMO ENDS JUNE 19&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nSpring 2016 Special  \r\n40GB Storage  \r\nUnlimited Email Accounts  \r\nUnlimited Domains  \r\n$40 / 2 years (biennially)  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=44\"&gt;Order Here&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nSome changes have been made over time, for those familiar with MXroute but maybe not up to date with the latest news:\r\n\r\n- OwnCloud support will be removed at the end of 2016. It is no longer advertised.  \r\n- Z-Push support will be removed at the end of 2016. It may be followed by a replacement. As it stands, maintenance for a high volume instance takes away from time better spent working on a new solution.\r\n\r\nSome of the features of MXroute:\r\n\r\n- Server-side email filters  \r\n- Email forwarding  \r\n- MailChannels for outgoing email  \r\n- POP3 / IMAP / SMTP  \r\n- Roundcube / Squirrelmail / Horde Webmail  \r\n- Backup and download your data at any time  \r\n- cPanel based control\r\n\r\nAny questions, feel free to ask :)"}
