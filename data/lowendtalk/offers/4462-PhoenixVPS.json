It's almost one of those \"once in a lifetime opportunities\" - that's how good this deal is. All that we ask in return is that you spread the word about **VPS Node Box** :)\r\n\r\nI know that many of you have seen all kinds of crazy deals lately for OpenVZ or even KVM VPS packages that promise allot of resources for a very low price (especially RAM which can easily be oversold with OpenVZ or KVM virtualization platforms), but we don't offer anything like that. We use Xen PV as our virtualization platform and all resources are guaranteed. As you know Xen is pretty much impossible to oversell (the only way to do it would be to run the same kernel on the guest OS as on the host OS and use memory ballooning, but we allow our customers to run what ever kernel they want on their VPS, so if you are on one of our VPS servers you can roll your own kernel).\r\n\r\nOur web site is: http://www.vpsnodebox.com\r\nMore information about us: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/about-us\r\nContact page: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/contact-us\r\nOur blog: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/blog\r\nXen VPS servers: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/vps-servers\r\nHybrid Cloud Hosting: http://www.vpsnodebox.com/cloud-hosting\r\n\r\nHere is the package that we are bringing you this week, with the following resources:\r\n\r\n**VPS 768**\r\nVirtualization Platform: Xen\r\nCPU Cores: 4 (8 Threads)\r\nGuaranteed RAM: 768MB\r\nSwap Space: 512MB\r\nRAID Disk Space: 36GB\r\nBandwidth: 300GB\r\nNetwork Speed: 100 Mbit\r\nDedicated IPv4 Addresses: 1\r\nAvailable IPv6 Addresses\r\nControl Panel: SolusVM\r\nMonthly Cost: $7 / month\r\n\r\nAll our Xen VPS Nodes are powered by Intel Xeon E3 CPUs with HyperThreading enabled running at 3.2GHz.\r\n\r\nDirect order link: https://portal.vpsnodebox.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of this offer use promo code: **VPSNODEBOX** - it's recurring for life!\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT** - We will be updating this thread later with ServerBear benchmark information. In the meantime we have here the benchmark from our previous offer (14 days ago) of 512MB VPS: http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2012/08/19/P2TnIhg3BdFkvNp4\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT** - For all those out there who are shamelessly practicing credit card fraud, we have implemented several layers of protection against you including CloudFlare (we are a certified partner by the way), MaxMind Fraud Detection, automatic activation is **disabled** and we also perform random verifications by phone. So if you placed your order don't panic if your VPS is not instantly provisioned, because as soon as order verification is complete we will provision it for you.\r\n\r\n**::Basic Server Info::**\r\n\r\nMemory:\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n[root@vps768 ~]# free -m\r\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\r\nMem:           748        122        625          0         23         55\r\n-/+ buffers/cache:         42        705\r\nSwap:          511          0        511\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nCPU:\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n[root@vps768 ~]# cat /proc/cpuinfo\r\nprocessor       : 0\r\nvendor_id       : GenuineIntel\r\ncpu family      : 6\r\nmodel           : 42\r\nmodel name      : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E31230 @ 3.20GHz\r\nstepping        : 7\r\ncpu MHz         : 3192.962\r\ncache size      : 8192 KB\r\nfdiv_bug        : no\r\nhlt_bug         : no\r\nf00f_bug        : no\r\ncoma_bug        : no\r\nfpu             : yes\r\nfpu_exception   : yes\r\ncpuid level     : 13\r\nwp              : yes\r\nflags           : fpu de tsc msr pae cx8 sep cmov pat clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht nx aperfmperf unfair_spinlock pni pclmulqdq ssse3 sse4_1 sse4_2 x2apic popcnt aes hypervisor arat epb pln pts dts\r\nbogomips        : 6385.92\r\nclflush size    : 64\r\ncache_alignment : 64\r\naddress sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual\r\npower management:\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n**Had to delete 6 CPUs, the post was getting to long, but you get the idea**\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nprocessor       : 7\r\nvendor_id       : GenuineIntel\r\ncpu family      : 6\r\nmodel           : 42\r\nmodel name      : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E31230 @ 3.20GHz\r\nstepping        : 7\r\ncpu MHz         : 3192.962\r\ncache size      : 8192 KB\r\nfdiv_bug        : no\r\nhlt_bug         : no\r\nf00f_bug        : no\r\ncoma_bug        : no\r\nfpu             : yes\r\nfpu_exception   : yes\r\ncpuid level     : 13\r\nwp              : yes\r\nflags           : fpu de tsc msr pae cx8 sep cmov pat clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht nx aperfmperf unfair_spinlock pni pclmulqdq ssse3 sse4_1 sse4_2 x2apic popcnt aes hypervisor arat epb pln pts dts\r\nbogomips        : 6385.92\r\nclflush size    : 64\r\ncache_alignment : 64\r\naddress sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual\r\npower management:\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nTest IP: 108.170.27.131\r\nTest files:\r\nhttp://www.vpsnodenox.com/10mb-test.bin\r\nhttp://www.vpsnodenox.com/100mb-test.bin\r\nhttp://www.vpsnodenox.com/1000mb-test.bin\r\nPhysical Server Location: Phoenix, AZ\r\n\r\nIn case you are wondering how long we have been in business, we started back in December of 2011 under the name Toratek .NET.
