Then we\u2019ll be offering different packages for different styles of online use.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about our services on our website: http://www.vpn.sh\r\n\r\nIf you want to sign up for the beta then make an account on [our order page](http://www.vpn.sh/clients/cart.php) and order the beta package then you\u2019ll receive all the relevant information in an email.\r\n\r\nPlease be patient as we predict a lot people will be trying to sign up and order over the next few days.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[Tweet us](http://www.twitter.com/vpnsh)\r\n[Like us on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/vpndotsh)\r\n\r\nNOTE: Just a quick note, some people have assumed that because PayPal is a payment option on the order page, we will charge. There's no details needed, as it's a free service, it won't ask for your PayPal details. It's just there ready for when we go live."}
