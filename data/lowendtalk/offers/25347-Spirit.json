Don't blame me if things don't go as expected - I just share my finding!   \r\nOffer seems time limited (until 16th April 2014).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    5 GB disk space\r\n    256 MB RAM (fully alocated)\r\n    CPU XEON E5/E3 / Opteron 6200/6300 (single core)\r\n    100 Mbps connectivity\r\n    unlimited data traffic\r\n    24/7 support\r\n    SMS restart\r\n    KVM/VNC console\r\n    1.46 \u20ac\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    10 GB disk space\r\n    512 MB RAM (fully alocated)\r\n    CPU XEON E5/E3 / Opteron 6200/6300 (single core)\r\n    100 Mbps connectivity\r\n    unlimited data traffic\r\n    24/7 support\r\n    SMS restart\r\n    KVM/VNC console\r\n    2.08 \u20ac\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    20 GB disk space\r\n    1 GB RAM (fully alocated)\r\n    CPU XEON E5/E3 / Opteron 6200/6300 (single core)\r\n    1 Gbps connectivity\r\n    unlimited data traffic\r\n    24/7 support\r\n    SMS restart\r\n    KVM/VNC console\r\n    4.16 \u20ac\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hukot.net/en/virtual-servery/\r\n\r\nTheir website state:\r\n\r\n&gt;  Currently we offer linux distributions Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, CentOS, Scientific, SuSe, Fedora, Elastix in the last stable version; from BSD family we offer FreeBSD and Debian kFreeBSD (Standardly we install 64 bit version - 32bit is also available if demanded) and from Microsoft: Windows XP, Windows 7 (Professional, Enterprise a Ultimate), Windows 2008 R2 Datacenter a Windows 2012 Datacenter - activation of the Windows operating system is directed by the customer.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Every virutual server is connected with 1Gbps to our network, which has connectivity 2 x 10 Gbps to NIX.
