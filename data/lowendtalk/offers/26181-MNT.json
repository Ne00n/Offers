Minimum required order (discounted) sum should be $15 or more. Eg. you can buy 512MB VPS for a $2.50/mo but you should order it from me for at least 6 months in order to reach a min. sum of $15 order. Orders which sum is less than $15 are not accepted.\r\n\r\nP.S.S. Accepted payment methods: Visa, Mastercard, Paypal.\r\n\r\nP.S.S.S. Reselling DO services is allowed by its own CEO - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/reselling-droplets"}
