I've spent some time thinking on what I can offer, that would be interesting for the users. At the end I've thought I could post a good offer for my new Lenoir, NC node at dacentec, that is still empty and not advertised anywhere else.\r\n\r\nI will skip the part of introduction, about the company and etc. You can read about those things in LEB (http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/liquidhost-openvz-and-kvm-anniversary-specials-in-seattle-and-dallas/#comments). There are plenty of comments left in there as well.\r\n\r\nI will post 2 different offers, that I've made especially for LET, one yearly and one monthly plan.\r\n\r\nLET2\r\n256MB of dedicated RAM\r\n256MB of vswap RAM (Making the total ram 512MB)\r\n2 vCPU\r\n20GB of disk space (RAID10 array)\r\n200GB of Bandwidth\r\n1 dedicated IP\r\n18$ per year, making it 1.5$ per month (can be paid annualy only)\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=87\r\n\r\nLET1\r\n1.5GB of dedicated RAM\r\nAnother 512MB of vswap (Making the total RAM 2048MB)\r\n4 vCPU\r\n50GB of HDD space (RAID10 array)\r\n800GB of Bandwidth\r\n7$ per month, can be paid on monthly basis. Of course - recurring pricing\r\nhttps://liquid-solutions.biz/clients/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=88\r\n\r\nThe VPS will be on 100mbps port.\r\n\r\nAs you probably have already firgured it out, they are running in Dacentec DataCenter on a configuration that was custom tailored for us.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny questions - feel free to PM me or shoot an email to support@liquid-solutions.biz . I will be happy to answer you!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlexander Barakov"}
