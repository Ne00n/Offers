VPS. \r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n*RAM: 256MB - 512MB\r\n*Bandwidth: 500GB\r\n*Diskspace: 500GB +\r\n\r\nLocation doesn't matter. OpenVZ/KVM/Whatever. Cost is more important. Bonus points for minimal debian template.\r\n\r\nIt will be used for a personal backup server, 1-3 users at most. \r\n\r\nAnyone have any good leads/offers?"}
