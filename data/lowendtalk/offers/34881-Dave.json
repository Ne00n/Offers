If you feel any anxiety or concern with our ToS, please don't sign up. It's a budget product with a specific value proposition for those that understand and accept what they're singing up for.\r\nFor those that don't yet know us, we're not a scam but we do our best to try to appear as one.\r\nCustom orders are available but only for quantities of 10 VPS or more.\r\n\r\nWhilst we support any hardware and infrastructure issues we provide no other support beyond this so you'll need to know how to install your VPS and configuring the network (i.e. entering the IP address, subnet, DNS servers - information available from within the control panel).\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds - these products are for people who know what they're doing so we ask you not to buy a DireVPS product unless you know what you're doing. If you don't have the expertise to manage a VPS yourself, please check out OpenITC instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n&amp;#42; If you really do want a free album of music, let us know in your order and we'll forward you a link to Jamendo - there are some great artists on there (some awful too)."}
