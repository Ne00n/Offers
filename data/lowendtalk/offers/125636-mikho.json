In the event of complete data loss your container will be re-created as soon as possible.\r\n  \r\n  **4) Will you help me install/set up X, Y, Z?**      \r\n       This is an unmanaged service, I will answer tickets about the service and how you use it to the best of my knowledge. If you need help with an installation or configuration, your best options are posting your questions at the [Lowendspirit ](http://forum.lowendspirit.com) forum or here.\r\n  \r\n  **5) TUN/TAP available?**      \r\n       Yes, enable/disable it from the WHMS integrated control panel.\r\n  \r\n  **6) Why does the service list a bandwidth limit when you offer unmetered ports?**       \r\n       When that limit is reached the VPS is not suspended like many other providers do. Your connection will only be limited to a lower (still acceptable) speed.\r\n       This is a part of the Fair Usage Policy.\r\n  \r\n  **7) What is this \"Fair Usage Policy\"?**        \r\n       Here on LET it's called \"The Golden Rule\";\r\n &gt; &gt; Don\u2019t be a dick.\r\n &gt; &gt; Do unto others. Don't do things that decades of netiquette have shown to be offensive. Don't be That Guy. Don't break the rules. When in doubt, don't.\r\n &gt; &gt; Just don't be a dick.\r\n       \r\n \r\n  **8) Examples of unacceptable content/applications**         \r\n  \r\n      * TOR\r\n      * Open proxies\r\n      * Port scanning\r\n      * website and/or service in regards to pirated software\r\n      * Crypto Mining\r\n      * IRC Servers \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  NOTE: Breaking the Fair Usage Policy will not get you suspended, it will get you terminated.\r\n  If you have a question about acceptable applications, post it in the [Lowendspirit ](http://forum.lowendspirit.com) forum.\r\n \r\n \r\n"}
