Users who sign up here will receive information on how to register for Beta access. Additionally, communication will be available between the Beta group and our Development Team for open discussion.\r\n\r\n&gt; To sign up for the mailing list please visit http://go.whmcs.com/58/betalist\r\n\r\n&gt; As always, a Beta release is not intended for production use. Beta software may contain bugs and therefore we only recommend participating in the Beta if you are able to run it in a test/development environment, and are comfortable with both experiencing and reporting bugs.\r\n\r\n&gt; Full release information will be available on 5.2 once it reaches the Release tier.\r\n\r\nWe already got the source code of WHMCS 5.2, if you need the code of includes/**licensefunction.php** (not encrypted), please send your request to: **whmcs@tempemail.net** or simply PM me."}
