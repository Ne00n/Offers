Our network is located in a secure private suite inside the Houston CenturyLink/Level3 Tier1 \u201cPremier Datacenter\u201d. This datacenter is the main routing point serving the Houston Metropolitan area. For Internet bandwidth, our dedicated uplink is 100Gb/s over fiber directly to Tier 1 CenturyLink/Level3. CenturyLink/Level3 is multi-homed and multi peered, so we deliver highest reliability and lowest latency access to the Internet. In addition, we use Corero DDos Mitigation to protect your server.\r\n\r\nBy owning and managing all equipment, we have total control of how our services are deployed, managed, secured, and supported. In our suite we use new Cisco hardware, resulting in some of the fastest routing on the market. Each rack has a 10Gb/s uplink so there is always plenty of bandwidth to all customers for every service we sell. Many providers resell lower Tier data at the mercy of some other companies\u2019 priorities and equipment problems - Not Oplink.net. Most other providers don\u2019t come close to the quality of bandwidth and services we offer.\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re looking for a provider these things are important. Choose Oplink.net for the best, most reliable, secure, and fastest solution.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n**Company News**\r\n-----------------------\r\nFeb, 2020: We are now offering 1 Gbps Unmetered ports with all colo servers and dedicated servers.
