However, since my situation of life changed (finished university) I now have to care about a job. Therefore I don't have the time to care about my VPS anymore. Since I do not want to leave it running without any purpose I want to sell it to somebody who has a purpose for it.\r\n\r\n*Facts:*\r\n\r\n128MB RAM + 256MB burst OpenVZ\r\n15Gb Space + 500GB Bandwidth\r\n2x IPv4 + 16x Ipv6 \r\npaid until 15.08.2012 \r\n\r\n*+ $18.63 credit balance already paid in!* Yes, I'm one of those clients that put a positive credit balance on their account. The offer includes this positive balance.\r\n\r\n*Notice:*\r\n\r\nThe rules for selling this VPS are given me by BuyVM. To be able to buy this VPS you must either be a customer of them or be known to them. I talked to @aldryic about this. If you are in doubts, I guess BuyVM will be happy to answer.\r\n\r\n*Price*\r\n\r\nThe package includes 2x IPv4-Address. The base package (1x IPv4 costs $15/year), plus the additional IPv4 that makes $27/year. The package has been already paid until 15th August 2012. Which means you have 6 month to go until the next paymant is due. Additionally, you get the credit balance of $18.63. *The value is therefor equal to at least $32.50*.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, PM me and we can work this out. Payment is done via Paypal to me. \r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n*nabo*"}
