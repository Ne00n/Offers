We ran a very thorough beta test of our service before going public. Let\u2019s get down to the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n Just some things to let everyone know how transparent we are:\r\n\r\n      Support is not 24/7 (Normal hrs. CST 8am-11pm)\r\n      All orders are manual verified\r\n      Setup time frame can take upwards of 24hrs (Usually quicker) \r\n      If you got a question please open a ticket! \r\n      All vps's are on a FAIR SHARE usage policy of the CPU CORES within certain limits. (TOS)\r\n      We use SolusVM for the control panel.\r\n      I know our website looks like crap and https:// for our main does not work! \r\n\r\n\r\nLocation of the node is out of the Immedion Datacenter located in Asheville, NC.\r\n\r\n   Test IP: 208.83.142.198\r\n   \r\n   Payment Processor: Paypal or Bitpay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n        64M ram / 64M VSWAP\r\n        10 gigs of diskspace (Raid 10)\r\n        100 gigs of bw @ 1Gbps\r\n        NAT ipv4 19 ports / 1 ssh\r\n        /112 ipv6\r\n        $2.50 a yr\r\n        https://my.aggressivenetworks.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=1\r\n\r\n        128M ram / 128M vswap\r\n        15 gigs of diskspace\r\n        200 gigs of bw @ 1 Gbps\r\n        NAT ipv4 19 ports / 1 ssh \r\n        /112 ipv6\r\n        $3.50 a yr\r\n        https://my.aggressivenetworks.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2\r\n               \r\n        256M ram / 256M vswap\r\n        20 gigs of diskspace\r\n        300 gigs of bw @ 1 Gbps\r\n        NAT ipv4  19 ports / 1 ssh \r\n        /112 ipv6\r\n        $4.50 a yr\r\n        https://my.aggressivenetworks.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen a Ticket to get get double the bandwidth!\r\n\r\n"}
