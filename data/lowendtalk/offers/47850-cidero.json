But the dedicated servers are nice, on the US one I even got 500GB disks and 6GB RAM. The network in Europe is good, they have their own datacenter with tens of thousands of servers. But they still don't provide IPv6 :(\r\nApparently only people from Europe are able to order on server4you.net. Others would have to order from server4you.com where the same offer costs 21.49US$ which is 19.70\u20ac."}
