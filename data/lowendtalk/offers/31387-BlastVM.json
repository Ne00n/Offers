How ever in total our Dallas Location has up to 100Gbps / 200Mpps filtering capability.\r\n\r\nOur XEN Platform is powered by XEN 4.3.3 compiled by BlastVM Including Kernel 3.1 so that we can offer the best stability. as we found that a majority of other Providers who utilize XEN do it incorrectly. and as a result you don't see native performance.\r\n\r\nDue to IPv4 shortages on our XEN Nodes we are currently unable to offer any Trials like on our last offer. how ever we are buying a few /24 IPv4 for our new Seattle Location going live late next month. we hope to be able to serve the LET Community with even better deals on DDoS Protected VPS with up to 40Gbps Filtering in Seattle."}
