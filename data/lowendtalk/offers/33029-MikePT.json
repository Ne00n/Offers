You will not be contacted to renew. We really want you to test it and enjoy it. After the trial, you're free to let us know that you want to renew it for its full price or just let it go. \r\n\r\nConditions to apply:\r\n\r\n- You need to have more than 20 posts;\r\n- LET account must be older than 3 months;\r\n- You will NOT use the container to cause any damage, mainly DDoS, SPAM and related. Those will be terminated in no time.\r\n\r\nYou'll be given access to SolusVM and we'd appreciate your feedback so we can improve the service.\r\n\r\nHow to apply:\r\n\r\n- Email me directly to miguel@whplace.com, note that our website is not finished yet, we're still working on it.\r\n\r\nEmail Template:\r\n\r\n**Name:**\r\n\r\n**LET Nickname:**\r\n\r\n**What kind of software will you be running in the VPS:**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks all, feel free to ask any other question you may have.\r\n\r\n(Edit: Mods, please move this topic if I posted it in the wrong section)."}
