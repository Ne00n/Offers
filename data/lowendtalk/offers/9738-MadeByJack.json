I have lots of experience designing web hosts, portfolios and wordpress themes - but I can pretty much design anything! So I'm currently looking to take on client work. You can see my previous work and also the recent stuff I've been working on at:\r\n\r\nwww.madebyjack.net\r\nwww.work.madebyjack.net\r\nwww.dribbble.com/inz\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in working with me then get in touch - I'm ready to start work straight away! I can accept Paypal, Moneybookers and UK bank transfer.\r\n\r\nContact details are available on my website :)"}
