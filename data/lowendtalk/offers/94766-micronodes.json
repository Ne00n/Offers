We have spent many years buying hosting ourselves and know what kind of a host a customer wants. We sell unmanaged VPS's, but we provide as much support as we can. We will even help customers set up game servers on their VPS's as well. Our VPS's can have Windows (Bring Your Own License). Our goal is to provide fast support, high quality VPS's at an affordable rate. We utilize SpartanHost through Psychz Datacenter to host our nodes in Dallas, Texas.\r\n\r\n**Test IP: 104.194.219.194**\r\n\r\n**100 MB Test File: https://micronodes.net/testfile/100MB.zip**\r\n\r\n**Node Specs**: - 2x Intel Xeon L5520 @ 2.26GHz+ (4 cores/8 threads each CPU) - 24 gb DDR3 ECC RAM - 4TB HDD (3 HDDs) - 1Gbps uplink (Backed by 10gbps fiber port)\r\n\r\nEach VPS is backed by a 1gbps uplink hosted on a 10gbps network port.\r\n\r\n**Plans and Pricing (Use promo code \"KVM25\" for 25% off recurring):**\r\n\r\n-**512MB RAM PLAN**\r\n\r\n-1024MB Swap\r\n\r\n-1x vCPU\r\n\r\n-30GB HDD space\r\n\r\n-500GB transfer\r\n\r\n-1Gbps uplink\r\n\r\n-1x IPv4\r\n\r\n-KVM/Virtualizer\r\n\r\n-Coupon: LEB30\r\n\r\n-$4/month\r\n\r\n-$3/month w/ KVM25\r\n\r\n-Order link (https://micronodes.net/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-**1024MB RAM PLAN**\r\n\r\n-1024MB Swap\r\n\r\n-2x vCPU\r\n\r\n-75GB HDD space\r\n\r\n-2TB transfer\r\n\r\n-1Gbps uplink\r\n\r\n-1x IPv4\r\n\r\n-KVM/Virtualizer\r\n\r\n-Coupon: KVM25\r\n\r\n-$7/month\r\n\r\n-$5.25/month w/ KVM25\r\n\r\n-Order link (https://micronodes.net/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Each additional IPV4 is $2.50/IP.
