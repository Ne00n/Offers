We currently light at GigE but it is a simple job to swap optics when we are ready to go to 10GE.  At present there is plenty of capacity available but we keep a constant watch on the usage so that we can add additional capacity as soon as it is required.  Our servers  themselves are fed from a gigabit port on a Cisco 6513 chassis switch which has sufficient capacity to provide the same to all 420 servers that the site will eventually hold.
