We have great service and great true 24/7 support; you'll love us!\r\n\r\nSome company info:\r\nWe've been up and running since May of 2011. We're running OpenVZ virtualization on our very own Dell, HP, and Supermicro -powered hardware.\r\nEach server node has it's own 100mbit connection. \r\nPast-30-days support ticket mean response time: 0 Day(s) 0 Hour(s) 19 Minute(s) and 51 Second(s)\r\n\r\n**The Offers:**\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n**_CopperKVM:_**\r\n512mb of RAM\r\n20 gigabytes of RAID10, SSD-cached disk space\r\n750gb monthly transfer\r\n1 fair-share CPU core\r\n1 IPv4 address\r\n\r\n&lt;s&gt;$9.99&lt;/s&gt; &lt;b&gt;$6.99&lt;/b&gt;/month with 30%-off coupon code &lt;b&gt;KVM30-MAR13&lt;/B&gt;\r\nBuffalo, NY order link: https://billingcp.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;systpl=ipx3&amp;pid=75\r\n\r\nNeed more resources, or want an even cheaper plan?

Please note that the point of this plan is for storage/backup; you'll be placed into the lowest i/o priority, and you get half of a CPU. Do not expect a blazingly-fast product here.\r\n\r\n150gb RAID10 disk space\r\n1024mb guaranteed RAM\r\n128mb vSwap\r\n500gb monthly transfer\r\n1 IPv4 address\r\n**1/2 of one CPU core**\r\n**lowest I/O priority pool**\r\n\r\n$4.00/month\r\nBuffalo, NY order link: https://billingcp.us/cart.php?a=add&amp;systpl=ipx3&amp;pid=85\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**FYI: As outlined in our AUP/TOS ( http://ipxcore.com/auptos/ ), all new registrations MUST be made with verifiable postal address information.** Repeating your province/state in the address fields will cause your account to be suspended til you update your account information.
