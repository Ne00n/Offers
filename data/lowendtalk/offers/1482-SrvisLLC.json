We are one of the few VPS providers in Metro-Detroit. From what we have found we are the only offering OpenVZ.\r\n\r\nWe are located at the Waveform data-center in Troy, MI.\r\n\r\nWe believe in great customer support and working with clients one on one if they have a issue, not just saying we will look into this ten times. We want to be open with our clients and help them as much as we can even though we only offer unmanaged services.\r\n\r\n**Our current LET discount is as follows:**\r\nYou will get our RAM-1024 plan for $7/m instead of the usual $8.50.\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\nGuaranteed-Ram: 1024MB\r\nvSwap: 512MB\r\nRAID Storage:  15GB\r\nBandwidth: 75GB\r\nvCPU Cores: 2\r\n\r\n$7.00/m\r\n\r\nTo order use the coupon:\r\n`RamLET`\r\n\r\nWith the link:\r\nhttps://www.errantweb.com/client/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=10\r\n\r\nWe hope that you guys like this plan!\r\nOnce sold out we may add more to stock."}
