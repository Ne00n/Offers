I'm looking for someone that can work during Saturday/Sunday during main business hours (9 - 5 PST)  at minimum. The more days you want to work the better, but those are the minimum.\r\n\r\nThe perfect candidate would have:\r\n\r\n- Experience with cPanel and at least dabbed into Directadmin. Experience in Directadmin would be a huge plus.\r\n- A good handling on trouble shooting and debugging. I need someone that can work at a problem, even if it means trolling around stackoverflow. \r\n- A decent grasp of the english language. Other languages such as Spanish and Chinese would be a huge plus. \r\n- Experienced in Linux at the very least. Experience in Windows would be a major positive.\r\n\r\nWage will be negotiated.\r\n \r\nPlease PM me here with your resumes or just to talk things over.\r\n\r\nFrancisco"}
