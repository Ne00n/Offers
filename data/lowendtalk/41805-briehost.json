There is a current theoretical maximum of 4.3 billion unique IPv4 addresses, whereas IPv6 has a ludicrous maximum of 340 trillion, trillion, trillion unique IPv6 addresses\u2026 enough to never run out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**How to make your IPv6 web server accessible to all IPv4 visitors:**&lt;br&gt;\r\nBy using CloudFlare's free Automatic IPv4 to IPv6 gateway, your website can be made accessible to any visitor online. Best part is, it can be turned on with a few clicks from your CloudFlare panel. Check their website for more information on how to set it up: https://www.cloudflare.com/ipv6 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**Some more reasons to start learning how to use IPv6:**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen networking gurus and researchers developed IPv4 security hadn't really crossed their minds. IPv4 was never meant to be secure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIPv6 has been built from the ground up with security in mind. Many of the security features that have been duct-taped after the fact onto IPv4 as optional features are integrated into IPv6 as default requirements. IPv6 encrypts traffic and checks packet integrity to provide VPN-like protection for standard Internet traffic.\u201d&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n-Tony Bradley, PCWorld&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\u201cIPv6's simplified packet header makes packet processing more efficient. Compared with IPv4, IPv6 contains no IP-level checksum, so the checksum does not need to be recalculated at every router hop. Getting rid of the IP-level checksum was possible because most link-layer technologies already contain checksum and error-control capabilities. In addition, most transport layers, which handle end-to-end connectivity, have a checksum that enables error detection.\u201d&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n-NetworkComputing.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n\u201cIPv6 supports multicast rather than broadcast. Multicast allows bandwidth-intensive packet flows (like multimedia streams) to be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously, saving network bandwidth. Disinterested hosts no longer must process broadcast packets. In addition, the IPv6 header has a new field, named Flow Label, that can identify packets belonging to the same flow.\u201d&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n-The Activo Team"}
