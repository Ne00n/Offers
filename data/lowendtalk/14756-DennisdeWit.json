It is meant as a test, but you can keep it for an undecided time.\r\n\r\nI give 3 shoutcast servers away. \r\n\r\nThe rules:\r\n- I am not responsible for licensing. Bring your own broadcasting license. Any takedown notice by DMCA / RIAA will be taken serious.\r\n- You have to use it.\r\n- Maximum bitrate: 128kbps\r\n- Maximum listeners: 50\r\n\r\nIf you want one, leave a post. First three requesters get one."}
