No one knows what the future will bring.\r\n\r\nSo invest in some LunaNode services before it's too late! We have been playing Kerbal Space Program and soon will have mastered rockets so that we can put servers on the moon. We just need a few more boosters.\r\n\r\nWhoever posts the comment that gets most thanks in this thread as of ~Sep10 gets $200 account credit (excluding my comments...). Credit is transferable as a bundle but can't be split, i.e., if you don't want the credit then you can give $200 to someone else but can't give $50 to four other people.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess only thanks from users registered before 1 September 2019 count. Multiple thanks on one comment from the same user is okay (all of them count)!"}
