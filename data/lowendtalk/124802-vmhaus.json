We've took a small break from some offer posts, lot's have happened including a new panel, new locations and some personal stuff. Lot's going on and that's why I'm excited to bring you our latest offerings&lt;br /&gt;\r\nNot everyone likes everyone and everything, it would be a pretty boring world if we did, so we offer a 7 day money back guarantee if the performance isn't as described.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our Features (We have a lot)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - Instant Activation (Subject to fraud checks)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - NVMe Powered Disk - It's even faster than SATA SSD Disks! Getting running away from those normies.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - One-click OS Install with ready templates - CentOS, Debian, Suse, Ubuntu&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - Custom ISO - Use our available Windows &amp; FreeBSD or bring your own ISO. (Just submit a ticket)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - Automated Backup - All VPS are automatically backed up to a separate storage server within the same data center on a Daily Basis (This means the backups are NOT offsite and we still recommend you keep your own backup of data).&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - Free Anti DDoS Pro Protection&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - Hourly billing&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; - SSH Key Support!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ServerIO Benchmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; Link: https://serverscope.io/trials/N0AB&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Network Information&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;London, United Kingdom - Clouvider Telehouse North 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp;  Test IPv4: 185.214.69.254&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp;  Test IPv6: 2a06:82c2::1&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our NVMe KVM VPS Offers:-&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Plan: VMH-512MB&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1x CPU Core E3-1270v6 (Shared)\r\n&amp;nbsp; 512MB DDR4 RAM\r\n&amp;nbsp; 10GB NVMe Disk Space\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1TB Bandwidth\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1Gbps Port\r\n&amp;nbsp; Anti DDoS Included\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1x IPv4\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1x IPv6\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1 x Automated Backup Slot (Daily)\r\n&amp;nbsp; Bonsai Control Panel\r\n&lt;b&gt;Price: $3 / Month ($0.0041/hour)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Signup:&lt;/b&gt; https://bonsai.vmhaus.com/signup\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Plan: VMH-1GB&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; 2x CPU Core E3-1270v6 (Shared)\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1GB DDR4 RAM\r\n&amp;nbsp; 15GB NVMe Disk Space\r\n&amp;nbsp; 2TB Bandwidth\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1Gbps Port\r\n&amp;nbsp; Anti DDoS Included\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1x IPv4\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1x IPv6\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1 x Automated Backup Slot (Daily)\r\n&amp;nbsp; Bonsai Control Panel\r\n&lt;b&gt;Price: $5 / Month ($0.0068/hour)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Signup:&lt;/b&gt; https://bonsai.vmhaus.com/signup\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Plan: VMH-2GB&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; 2x CPU Core E3-1270v6 (Shared)\r\n&amp;nbsp; 2GB DDR4 RAM\r\n&amp;nbsp; 30GB NVMe Disk Space\r\n&amp;nbsp; 4TB Bandwidth\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1Gbps Port\r\n&amp;nbsp; Anti DDoS Included\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1x IPv4\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1x IPv6\r\n&amp;nbsp; 1 x Automated Backup Slot (Daily)\r\n&amp;nbsp; Bonsai Control Panel\r\n&lt;b&gt;Price: $7 / Month ($0.0096/hour)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;Signup:&lt;/b&gt; https://bonsai.vmhaus.com/signup\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\nOur London Virtual Machines are inside @Clouvider\u2019s new Telehouse North 2 data center. The latest addition to the Clouvider and VMHaus family. The Clouvider network vastly improves our connectivity in London including direct peering with Liberty Global (Virgin Media, UPC, Aorta and more) with direct and recently upgraded ports to LINX 1 &amp; 2 (which allows us to peer with BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Zen and more!) and up links include the usual (Level3, NTT, GTT, Telia, Cogent)\r\n\r\nThanks to some recent upgrades out Clouvider their network is now locally DDoS protected thanks to our on-site DDoS protection with NTT protection staying on hand for those larger attacks\r\n\r\nAs for our hardware we\u2019ve gone with a brand spanking new Xeon E3-1270 v6 which clocks in at 3.8GHz with a nice little boost to 4.2GHz. We've also added 64GB of ECC DDR4 RAM for good measure finally backed by our 1TB Samsung NVMe disks which give your applications that little push to run faster.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry to say we've excluded our VMH-256MB plan currently from Bonsai. We are looking into re-adding them in the future along with our existing locations. We have lots planned for Bonsai which will allow us to improve our overall service.\r\n\r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quick Links&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; Node Status: http://status.vmhaus.com&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; Bonsai Control Panel: https://bonsai.vmhaus.com&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; Website: https://www.vmhaus.com&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; FAQ: https://www.vmhaus.com/#faq&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp; Terms of Service: http://vmhaus.com (Click legal)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nYour friends at VMHaus"}
