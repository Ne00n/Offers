It's funded through donations and is available to LET users who have held accounts (with good reputation) for 6 months or more.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about it [here](https://clients.hadrill.co.uk/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=2).\r\n\r\nThe four servers that are available will have the following specs:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt; 1 vCPU&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt; 256MB RAM&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt; 500GB HDD (no raid, no backups)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt; 1TB BW @ 1 Gbps (shared port)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt; Hosted at Online.net in France&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\nVMs automatically expire after 30 days but can be extended by throwing in a ticket (provided you get in touch in plenty of time).\r\n\r\nI'd ideally like to keep the 500GB plans to donators, but that is by no means a rule.\r\n\r\nAs always, donations are always welcome [here](https://clients.hadrill.co.uk/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=4). The service is currently funded until sometime in May. \r\n\r\nDrop me a PM if you're interested, I'll try and sort out any requests on a first come first-served basis (provided you fit the criteria) later tonight else tomorrow :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy crapping!"}
