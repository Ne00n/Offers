Due to this, we've been able to provide close support with them and still be able to meet our overhead costs.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Update on the Singapore VPS Situation&lt;/strong&gt;\r\nI know people are pretty eager to test out the Singapore VPS's as well. All I can say at this point is, it's nearly ready, but not fully ready [yet]. This is due to the situation on the lack of IP Addresses and Network Bandwidth. It's currently only able to push about 66Mbps despite being on a 100Mbps uplink port. [Hopefully] it would be ready by March - April.\r\n\r\nFollow us on our social mediums!\r\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/LoomHosts\r\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/LoomHosts"}
