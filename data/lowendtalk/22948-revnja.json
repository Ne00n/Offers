All memory is brand new and unused, but was bought in bulk meaning that each still will only come in an anti-static bag and packed accordingly.  Please contact me if you are interested in buying more than 2 sticks or the whole lot of 16, as I would be willing to consider a hefty discount if you were to buy them all at once.\r\n\r\nRAM will be packed in anti-static bag with plenty of padding in a USPS Flat Rate Small Box.  I will get this out the next day after paying, possibly the same day depending when it's paid.  Please ensure this will work for your specific application before ordering, as I won't accept a return for that reason.\r\n\r\nLooking to get $75/stick, contact me if you are interested in the whole lot as I will let them go at a much discounted rate.  I am located in Alaska, USA, I would consider shipping internationally if the quantity is right (I won't ship one stick internationally, as it's kind of a hassle, sorry)\r\n\r\nI have received permission from a moderator to post this offer.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nSpecifications\r\n\r\n* Mfr Part Number: HMT31GR7BFR4C-H9D7\r\n* Type: DDR3\r\n* Capacity: 8 GB\r\n* Speed: PC10600 1333MHz\r\n* Size &amp; Bit: 512M x 4\r\n* Pins: 240pin\r\n* ECC: Yes\r\n* Registered: Yes\r\n* Chip: Hynix\r\n* Rank: 2\r\n* CL 9"}
