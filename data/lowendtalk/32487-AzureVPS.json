Open a ticket with us after ordering if you want to take advantage of this offer.\r\n\r\nAll payment right now is handled through Paypal, and a seven day refund is offered for all new customers.\r\n\r\nNone of our RAM nor drive space will be oversold; the plans have been configured such that each's RAM and drive space are exactly double that of the previous one, and along with a proper max resource allocation limit, will prevent the overselling of those resources.\r\n\r\nCurrently the SSD only caches reads, but fortunately the majority of real world IO usage is reads. Write caching is planned. Dirty cache random read IOPs was measured to be [~25K with 4kB blocks, or ~100MB/s](http://pastebin.com/khE3K1qP). CPU and network bandwidth is shared across all VPSs on the node with a fair share policy.\r\n\r\nOur [AUP](https://azurevps.com/acceptable-use-policy) and [TOS](https://azurevps.com/terms-of-service) in a nutshell is: Nothing illegal. Nothing constantly resource intensive; Disruptive CPU or network usage will have those resources throttled respectively. IRC, game servers and legal adult content are allowed.\r\n\r\nWe will reply to all support tickets within 24 hours and strive to provide a pleasant experience as possible.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://azurevps.com/ &lt;br /&gt;\r\nNetwork test files: [10MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/10mb.bin) | [100MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/100mb.bin) &lt;br /&gt;\r\nNetwork test IPs: 107.155.70.194 | 2604:880:1:2:0:2:b84:b437"}
