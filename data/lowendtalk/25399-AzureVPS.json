We also aren't just another Colocrossing provider; instead we're with Incero.\r\n\r\nNormally, our VPS prices start at around $8/GiB/month, but we're currently offering **15% off recurring** for all quarterly and annually billed plans for new clients exclusively for LET/LEB.\r\n\r\nThe coupon used for all plans is **LETSAVE15R**\r\n\r\n**CVZ-128**\r\n\r\n- 1 Accessible E3 Core (3.3+ GHz)\r\n- 128/128 MiB RAM/vSwap\r\n- 7 GiB RAID10 SSD-Cached Space\r\n- 75 GiB Data at 1gbps\r\n- 1 IPv4 Address\r\n- 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n- **$3.40 per quarter ($1.13/mo)**\r\n- [Order now!](https://azurevps.com/client-area/cart.php?gid=1&amp;pid=1)\r\n\r\n**CVZ-256**\r\n\r\n- 1 Accessible E3 Core (3.3+ GHz)\r\n- 256/256 MiB RAM/vSwap\r\n- 15 GiB RAID10 SSD-Cached Space\r\n- 150 GiB Data at 1gbps\r\n- 1 IPv4 Address\r\n- 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n- **$5.95 per quarter ($1.63/mo)**\r\n- [Order now!](https://azurevps.com/client-area/cart.php?gid=1&amp;pid=3)\r\n\r\n**CVZ-512**\r\n\r\n- 2 Accessible E3 Cores (3.3+ GHz)\r\n- 512/512 MiB RAM/vSwap\r\n- 30 GiB RAID10 SSD-Cached Space\r\n- 300 GiB Data at 1gbps\r\n- 1 IPv4 Address\r\n- 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n- **$9.69 per quarter ($3.23/mo)**\r\n- [Order now!](https://azurevps.com/client-area/cart.php?gid=1&amp;pid=4)\r\n\r\n**CVZ-1024**\r\n\r\n- 3 Accessible E3 Cores (3.3+ GHz)\r\n- 1/1 GiB RAM/vSwap\r\n- 60 GiB RAID10 SSD-Cached Space\r\n- 600 GiB Data at 1gbps\r\n- 1 IPv4 Address\r\n- 16 IPv6 Addresses\r\n- **$18.36 per quarter ($6.12/mo)**\r\n- [Order now!](https://azurevps.com/client-area/cart.php?gid=1&amp;pid=5)\r\n\r\nAn unlimited number of extra IPv4 addresses are available for $3/quarter each, but each extra address must have justification for its use.\r\n\r\nExtra data is also available for $5/TiB/quarter which is 50% off our normal price for data. Open a ticket with us after ordering if you want to take advantage of this offer.\r\n\r\nAll payment right now is handled through Paypal, and a seven day refund is offered for all new customers.\r\n\r\nNone of our RAM nor drive space will be oversold; the plans have been configured such that each's RAM and drive space are exactly double that of the previous one, and along with a proper max resource allocation limit, will prevent the overselling of those resources.\r\n\r\nCurrently the SSD only caches reads, but fortunately the majority of real world IO usage is reads. Write caching is planned. Dirty cache random read IOPs was measured to be [~25K with 4kB blocks, or ~100MB/s](http://pastebin.com/khE3K1qP). CPU and network bandwidth is shared across all VPSs on the node with a fair share policy.\r\n\r\nOur [AUP](https://azurevps.com/acceptable-use-policy) and [TOS](https://azurevps.com/terms-of-service) in a nutshell is: Nothing illegal. Nothing constantly resource intensive; Disruptive CPU or network usage will have those resources throttled respectively. IRC, game servers and adult content are allowed.\r\n\r\nWe will reply to all support tickets within 24 hours and strive to provide a pleasant experience as possible.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://azurevps.com/ &lt;br /&gt;\r\nNetwork test files: [10MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/10mb.bin) | [100MB](http://water.cvz.azurevps.com/100mb.bin) &lt;br /&gt;\r\nNetwork test IPs: 107.155.70.194 | 2604:880:1:2::2"}
