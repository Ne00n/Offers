One of the advantages over using a VPN that this won't slow your internet since it only proxy specific websites.\r\n\r\nI initially built this for myself however it takes some resources so I thought I could have a few clients here using it. I can add sites on demand but the most important ones are already supported (as in the title).\r\n\r\nI own a Roku device so that's supported for sure as well as computers. This can work with other devices too.\r\n\r\nSo anybody interested in just drop me a PM. As for the price I thought about something like 2.5USD monthly. (Negotiable)\r\n\r\nSupported services:\r\n\r\nNetflix\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nPandora\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nCrackle\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nHBOGO\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nHulu\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nVudu\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nAmazon Instant Video\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nMGO\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nESPN\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nPBS\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nCBS\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nAETV\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nFox\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nTargetTicket\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; \r\nShowtime"}
