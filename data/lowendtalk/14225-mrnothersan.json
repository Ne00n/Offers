Some providers call their services \"unmanaged\" and then don't give you any support at all. We advertise \"basic\" management - this means that your services aren't fully managed, however we won't leave you in the dark. We will help you. We have more great deals to come, but this one won't last long so grab one before stock runs out.\r\n\r\nToday, we'd like to present to you a 4GB RAM package at $7/mo and a 2GB RAM package at $4/mo.
