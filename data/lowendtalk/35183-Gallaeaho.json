Reviews are available on this forum, WHT, and on Google. Many people have openly expressed their opinions about our services, both positive and negative. We work towards achieving a high level of customer satisfaction (and will respond to all complaints) however we cannot satisfy everyone. We will work to the best of our ability to make sure you are satisfied however it is your choice whether or not to choose us as your hosting provider, we will not feed you bullshit to choose us.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are a good fit for most people and projects, we are not for everyone. We are a budget company, however give our very best efforts in satisfying everyone. The primary focus of our business is to provide a high value hosting service at the lowest prices possible while still maintaining an acceptable level of quality and service. We do not compete on quality, we compete on value and price. We back our promises with a 14 Day Money Back Guarantee, Anytime Money Back Warranty, 99.9% Uptime Guarantee, and Price Match Guarantee.\r\n______________________\r\n\r\n**Amsterdam High Bandwidth Special - ONLY 20 AVAILABLE**\r\n\r\n2 vCPUs Fair Share @ 3.4Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n15GB RAID-10 Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n2000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n786MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br&gt;\r\nFREE PositiveSSL Certificate (YEARLY ONLY)&lt;br&gt;\r\n$2.95/month or $12.95/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Amsterdam, Netherlands&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=324\r\n\r\n**Amsterdam Storage Special - ONLY 5 AVAILABLE**\r\n\r\n3 vCPUs Fair Share @ 3.4Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n100GB RAID-10 Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n5000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n1536MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap RAM&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br&gt;\r\nFREE PositiveSSL Certificate (YEARLY ONLY)&lt;br&gt;\r\n$4.95/month OR $35/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Amsterdam, Netherlands&lt;Br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=325\r\n\r\n**PURE SSD Bandwidth Special - ONLY 50 AVAILABLE**\r\n\r\n3 vCPUs Fair Share @ 3.4Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n10GB RAID-10 PURE SSD Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n8000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n768MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br&gt;\r\nPositiveSSL Certificate + $0.99 (Optional)&lt;br&gt;\r\n$4.99/quarter OR $12.49/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Los Angeles, California&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=326\r\n\r\n**PURE SSD All-Purpose Special - ONLY 50 AVAILABLE**\r\n\r\n5 vCPUs Fair Share @ 3.4Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n250GB RAID-10 PURE SSD Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n15000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n5120MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap\r\n5 IPv4 Addresses&lt;br&gt;\r\nPositiveSSL Certificate (QUARTERLY ONLY)&lt;br&gt;\r\n$5.99/month OR $15/quarter&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Los Angeles, California&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=327\r\n\r\n**MEGA RAM SPECIAL - ONLY 10 AVAILABLE**\r\n\r\n24 vCPUs Fair Share @ 2.0 or 2.1Ghz (E5-2620v1/v2)&lt;br&gt;\r\n300GB RAID-10 SSD Cached Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n12TB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n10GB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap&lt;br&gt;\r\n3 IPv4 Addresses&lt;br&gt;\r\nPositiveSSL Certificate (QUARTERLY ONLY)&lt;br&gt;\r\n$6.99/month OR $19/quarter&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Los Angeles, California OR Chicago, Illinois&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=332\r\n\r\n**MEGA IPv4 Special - WE GOT LOTS!**\r\n\r\n24 vCPUs Fair Share @ 2Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n15GB PURE SSD RAID-10 Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n2000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps (More bandwidth available!)&lt;br&gt;\r\n786MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap&lt;br&gt;\r\n20 IPv4 Addresses (WE GOT CLEAN ONES!)&lt;br&gt;\r\n$4.99/month OR $39/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Chicago, Illiois (Other locations may be available, please ASK!)&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=331\r\n\r\n**MEGA NATIONWIDE BANDWIDTH SPECIAL - WE GOT LOTS!**\r\n\r\n2 vCPUs Fair Share @ 3.4Ghz or 3.5Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n15GB SSD Cached RAID-10 Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n7000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n768MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br&gt;\r\n$2.99/month OR $19/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Buffalo, NY | Atlanta, GA | Chicago, IL | Dallas, TX | Los Angeles, CA&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**:  https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=330\r\n\r\n**MEGA BUFFALO STORAGE SPECIAL - ONLY 20 AVAILABLE**\r\n\r\n4 vCPUs Fair Share @ 3.4Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n275GB SSD Cached RAID-10 Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n5000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n1024MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IPv4 Address&lt;br&gt;\r\n$4.49/month OR $44/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Buffalo, NY&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=329\r\n\r\n**NATIONWIDE ALL-PURPOSE SPECIAL - WE GOT LOTS!**\r\n\r\n4 vCPUs Fair Share @ 3.4Ghz&lt;br&gt;\r\n150GB SSD Cached RAID-10 Disk Space&lt;br&gt;\r\n5000GB Premium Monthly Bandwidth @ 1Gbps&lt;br&gt;\r\n2024MB Guaranteed RAM / vSwap&lt;br&gt;\r\n2 IPv4 Addresses&lt;br&gt;\r\n$3.25/month OR $21/year&lt;br&gt;\r\nLocation: Buffalo, NY | Atlanta, GA | Chicago, IL | Dallas, TX | Los Angeles, CA&lt;br&gt;\r\n**Order URL**: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=328\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\nContact Information - We are always here for you !!\r\n\r\nSupport helpdesk: https://secure.greenvaluehost.com/clientarea.php&lt;BR&gt;\r\nMailing Address: PO Box 972, Normal, Illinois 61761\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: We accept no responsibility for neglect of reading and understanding our Terms of Service policies.
