We've spent some time setting this location up with a fully redundant core design. Dual routers &amp; Juniper switches at the core allow for redundancy. \r\n\r\nWe have also added Alipay for customers coming from China, we aim to add Wechat &amp; UnionPay in the upcoming weeks.\r\n\r\nNot everyone likes everyone and everything, it would be a pretty boring world if we did, so we offer a 7-day money back guarantee if the performance isn't as described. (Money back only applies to PayPal, Alipay currently is unable to be refunded)\r\n\r\nOur Features - Instant Activation (Subject to fraud checks)\r\n- Pure NVMe Powered Storage - It's even faster than SATA SSD Disks!  \r\n- One-click OS Install with ready templates - CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu  \r\n- Custom ISO - Bring your own ISO. (Just submit a ticket)  \r\n- Automated Backup - All VPS are automatically backed up on site.  \r\n- Free DDoS Protection  \r\n- Hourly billing  \r\n- SSH Key Support!  \r\n- BGP Sessions (Just open a ticket with your ASN and prefixes)  \r\n- Free ASN Registration service (for clients who maintains monthly servers worth $30)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNetwork Information London, United Kingdom - Telehouse North 2  \r\nAS Number: AS136620 https://bgp.he.net/AS136620  \r\nLooking Glass: http://lg.thn2.vmhaus.com  \r\nTest IPv4: 185.214.69.46   \r\nTest IPv6: 2a06:82c2:0:88::1  \r\n\r\nNetwork Information Los Angeles, United States - Quadranet Century  \r\nAS Number: AS136620 https://bgp.he.net/AS136620  \r\nLooking Glass: http://lg.lax.vmhaus.com  \r\nTest IPv4: 103.105.49.34   \r\nTest IPv6: 2402:28c0:2:310::1  \r\n\r\nOur NVMe KVM VPS Offers:-\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;**Plan: VMH-256MB**  \r\n  1x CPU Core E3-1270v6 (Shared)  \r\n  256MB DDR4 RAM  \r\n  5GB NVMe Disk Space  \r\n  500GB in LA/1TB in UK Bandwidth  \r\n  1Gbps Port   \r\n  DDoS Protected  \r\n  1x IPv4  \r\n  1x /64 IPv6 Block  \r\n  1 x Automated Backup Slot (Daily)  \r\n  Bonsai Control Panel   \r\n**Price: $15 / Year **  \r\nSign up: https://bonsai.vmhaus.com/signup  \r\nSign up and top-up $15 to deploy yearly instance.  \r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n**Plan: VMH-512MB**  \r\n  1x CPU Core E3-1270v6 (Shared)  \r\n  512MB DDR4 RAM  \r\n  10GB NVMe Disk Space  \r\n  1TB in LA/2TB in UK Bandwidth  \r\n  1Gbps Port  \r\n  DDoS Protected  \r\n  1x IPv4  \r\n  1x /64 IPv6 Block  \r\n  1 x Automated Backup Slot (Daily)  \r\n  Bonsai Control Panel  \r\n**Price: $3 / Month ($0.0041/hour)**  \r\nSign up: https://bonsai.vmhaus.com/signup  \r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n**Plan: VMH-1GB**  \r\n  2x CPU Core E3-1270v6 (Shared)  \r\n  1GB DDR4 RAM  \r\n  15GB NVMe Disk Space  \r\n  2TB in LA/4TB in UK Bandwidth    \r\n  1Gbps Port  \r\n  DDoS Protected  \r\n  1x IPv4  \r\n  1x /64 IPv6 Block  \r\n  1 x Automated Backup Slot (Daily)  \r\n  Bonsai Control Panel  \r\n**Price: $5 / Month ($0.0068/hour)**  \r\nSign up: https://bonsai.vmhaus.com/signup  \r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n**Plan: VMH-2GB**  \r\n  2x CPU Core E3-1270v6 (Shared)  \r\n  2GB DDR4 RAM  \r\n  30GB NVMe Disk Space  \r\n  4TB in LA/8TB in UK Bandwidth  \r\n  1Gbps Port  \r\n  DDoS Protected  \r\n  1x IPv4  \r\n  1x /64 IPv6 Block  \r\n  1 x Automated Backup Slot (Daily)  \r\n  Bonsai Control Panel  \r\n**Price: $7 / Month ($0.0096/hour)**  \r\nSign up: https://bonsai.vmhaus.com/signup  \r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nVMHaus is now an LIR with the recent membership we obtained from APNIC. As a value-added service to our customers, we are now providing free ASN Registration service for those who maintain $30 worth of servers monthly with us. \r\n\r\nOur Los Angeles are inside Quadranet's brand new Century location. Quadranet's network includes GTT, PCCW, Cogent, Telia, Zayo, Hostnet and they peer directly with Google, HiNet, Any2 &amp; Equinix.\r\n\r\nHardware in Los Angeles includes Dual E5-2670 boxes with 128GB RAM backed by 1TB Samsung SSDs in RAID 10, providing that extra performance. With network provided by dual routers and switches and all hardware using dual PSU.\r\n\r\nOur London Virtual Machines are inside @Clouvider\u2019s new Telehouse North 2 data centre. The Clouvider network vastly improves our connectivity in London including direct peering with Liberty Global (Virgin Media, UPC, Aorta and more) with direct and recently upgraded ports to LINX 1 &amp; 2 (which allows us to peer with BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Zen and more!) and uplinks include the usual (Level3, NTT, GTT, Telia, Cogent). \r\n\r\nAs for our hardware in London we\u2019ve gone with a brand spanking new Xeon E3-1270 v6 which clocks in at 3.8GHz with a nice little boost to 4.2GHz. We've also added 64GB of ECC DDR4 RAM for good measure finally backed by our 1TB Samsung NVMe disks which give your applications that little push to run faster.\r\n\r\nWe also support IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions.\r\n\r\nQuick Links Node Status: http://status.vmhaus.com  \r\nBonsai Control Panel: https://bonsai.vmhaus.com  \r\nWebsite: https://www.vmhaus.com     \r\nFAQ: https://www.vmhaus.com/#faq  \r\nTerms of Service: http://vmhaus.com (Click legal)  \r\n\r\nThank You, Your friends at VMHaus"}
