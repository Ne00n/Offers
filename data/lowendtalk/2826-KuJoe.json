We have 5 of each option: 128MB, 256MB, and 512MB (all come with 5GB of disk space and 100GB of bandwidth to play with).\r\n\r\nThis is for testing only, these are not on production servers and do not have everything our public release will have (assuming we decide to offer KVM after testing is done). Right now we only offer 3 ISOs (Debian 6, CentOS 5.8, and Arch Linux), do not ask for more as we are not adding more in our test environment.\r\n\r\nhttps://my.securedragon.net/cart.php?gid=11\r\n\r\nAll VPSs last 14 days after order and we will manually provision orders to prevent abuse (I will process orders when I have time, it may be a few hours before I return to my PC so I apologize for the wait). Not all orders will be processed either so we apologize if your order does not make it. Thanks for your help! Any feedback you can provide would be appreciated!"}
