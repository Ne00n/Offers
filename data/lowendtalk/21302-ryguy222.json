Just use coupon code **3YEAR50** to receive 50% off for the life of the service!\r\n \r\n  **About EVL Gaming, LLC** We've been providing gaming and VPS services since 2011, and have always owned 100% of our hardware and networking equipment. Our clients also believe that we offer some of the best support in the industry as we never turn anyone away, and always point them in the right direction if they get lost or stuck in their VPS!\r\n \r\n EVL Gaming, LLC is registered and is in good standing with the Arizona Corporation Commission.\r\n \r\n **Hardware Specifications** Our budget series operates on Xeon E3-1230v2's with RAID 1 disk array's. Perfect for high cpu / medium IO usage.\r\n \r\n Our Enterprise Series operates on Dual Opteron 4226 Six-Core 2.7Ghz (3.1ghz turbo) CPU's, with a RAID 10 disk array (providing faster I/O speeds, perfect for databases, minecraft and many other applications).\r\n \r\n All of our servers utilize Supermicro enterprise grade motherboards, chassis, and power supplies. Here's some proof that we own our infrastructure --&gt; http://evlgaming.com/infrastructure\r\n \r\n **Ping/Trace/Speed Test**\r\n Phoenix Speed Test --&gt; http://209.250.6.57/speed/  (Or trace/ping 209.250.6.57)\r\n Kansas Speed Test --&gt; http://142.54.161.25/speed/  (Or trace/ping 142.54.161.25)\r\n\r\n **About our locations**\r\n We own all of our gear (aside from offsite dns/backups). That said we do not sell VPS off of rented Secured Servers in Phoenix, or Datashack in Kansas but rather colocate directly with these datacenters. This usually gives us better routing than those two services offer. \r\n \r\n LEB Plans\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Budget Series (We have very low stock left on this package act fast!) \r\n \r\n  *   CPU Cores: 1 \r\n  *   Memory: 512mb / 1024mb swap\r\n  *   Disk: 10GB RAID 1\r\n  *   Bandwidth: 20mbps / 300GB Transfer\r\n  *   OS: Linux Only (contact us for a custom ISO or OS)\r\n  *   IP's: 1 (Max 3 IP's $1.75 per IP) \r\n  *   Price: $3.50/mo ($1.75/mo with coupon code 3YEAR50)\r\n  *   Kansas City, MO Oak Tower\r\n  *   [Direct Order Link](https://myevl.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=5)     [View all Plans](http://evlgaming.com/vps) \r\n \r\n\r\nBudget Series 2\r\n \r\n *   CPU Cores: 1 \r\n *   Memory: 1024mb / 1536mb swap\r\n *   Disk: 25GB RAID 1\r\n *   Bandwidth: 25mbps / 500GB Transfer\r\n *   OS: Linux/ Windows (contact us for custom ISO or OS)\r\n *   IP's: 1 (Max 5 IP's $1.75 per IP) \r\n *   Price: $7.00/mo ($3.50/mo with coupon code 3YEAR50)\r\n *   Kansas City, MO Oak Tower\r\n *   [Direct Order Link](https://myevl.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2)     [View all Plans](http://evlgaming.com/vps) \r\n \r\n\r\nEnterprise Series\r\n \r\n  *   CPU Cores: 1 \r\n  *   Memory: 512mb / 1024mb swap\r\n  *   Disk: 15GB RAID 10\r\n  *   Bandwidth: 20mbps / 300GB Transfer\r\n  *   OS: Linux only (contact us for custom ISO or OS)\r\n  *   IP's: 1 (Max 5 IP's $1.75 per IP) \r\n  *   Price: $7.00/mo ($3.50/mo with coupon code 3YEAR50)\r\n  *   Kansas City, MO Oak Tower / OR Phoenix at PhoenixNAP!\r\n  *   [Direct Order Link Kansas](https://myevl.net/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=76) [Direct Order Link Phoenix](http://dev.evlgaming.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=97)     [View all Plans](http://evlgaming.com/vps) \r\n \r\n**Legal Stuff**\r\n  *   [View our Terms of Service](http://evlgaming.com/terms)\r\n  *   [View our Acceptable Usage Policy](http://evlgaming.com/aup)\r\n  *   Please note that some orders may require telephone verification and only orders above $100 require photo ID verification. \r\n\r\n**Windows Licenses**\r\n * You may use your own windows license if it is a volume license key, and works on a Server 2008 iso file. \r\n * We do not allow customers to upload their own Windows ISO's, that does mean you can only use Server 2008 R2 on our network.
