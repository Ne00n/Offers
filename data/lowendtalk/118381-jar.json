For that reason, I've added a new product line called MXroute Classic. It's simple, it's email, it does it's job. The important part is, it saves you money. If you don't need fancy things and you just need basic email for your domain, I've got you covered.\r\n\r\nFeatures:  \r\n- VestaCP for management  \r\n- Roundcube webmail  \r\n- POP3 / IMAP / SMTP  \r\n- MailChannels for outbound mail  \r\n- Backup relay in case of outages  \r\n- That's it.\r\n\r\nThings that you might notice missing:  \r\n- DKIM (seriously let it die)  \r\n- Server side filters\r\n\r\nWith that all said, here are the plans I'm offering. They are a spin on the original three listed at that archive link:\r\n\r\nClassicMXfree  \r\n1 Domain  \r\n1 Email Account  \r\n500MB Storage  \r\n60 outgoing per hour (soft limit, enforced only when causing problems, forwarding included in calculation)  \r\n$5 setup fee, then free  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=65\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nClassicMXone  \r\nUnlimited Domains  \r\nUnlimited Email Accounts  \r\n30GB Storage  \r\n$10/year  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=66\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nClassicMXfive  \r\nUnlimited Domains  \r\nUnlimited Email Accounts  \r\n75GB Storage  \r\n$25/year  \r\n&lt;a href=\"https://billing.mxroute.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=67\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nHave fun, and thanks for your support!"}
