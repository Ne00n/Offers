Is it available?**\r\n-------\r\nWe offer a separate lineup for Window VPSes.  Our 50% off for life promotion also applies to our Windows lineup, &lt;a href=\"https://www.stablebox.com/windows-ssd-cloud-vps-hosting/\"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\r\n\r\n**Why is Windows slightly more expensive?**\r\n------\r\nThe main factor is licensing costs - rather than spreading out the licensing costs to everyone, whether they choose Windows or another operating system (which would be a bit unfair!), we only factor the cost into our Windows lineup. This helps us keep prices low for everyone.\r\n\r\n**Do you allow game servers?**\r\n-------\r\nGame servers are typically extremely CPU-intensive. Therefore, we do not allow game servers to be hosted on our Stablebox VPS\u2019s. We do, however, offer game servers and VPSes specifically tailored for game server hosting via our gaming division, &lt;a href=\"https://www.purepings.com\"&gt;PurePings&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n**Do you allow adult content?**\r\n-------\r\nYes, we allow adult content as long as it is legal under United States law.\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nCONTACT US\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* **Sales**: [sales@stablebox.com](mailto:sales@stablebox.com)\r\n* **Support**: [support@stablebox.com](mailto:support@stablebox.com)\r\n* **Ticket System**: [https://portal.stablebox.com](https://portal.stablebox.com) (You must login to open a ticket with Support.)\r\n* **Billing System**: [https://portal.stablebox.com](https://portal.stablebox.com)\r\n* **Toll-Free Phone**: 1.800.284.6978\r\n* **Further Contact Details**: [https://www.stablebox.com/contact-us/](https://www.stablebox.com/contact-us/)\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* **About Us**: [https://www.stablebox.com/about/](https://www.stablebox.com/about/)\r\n* **Acceptable Use Policy**: [https://www.stablebox.com/acceptable-use-policy/](https://www.stablebox.com/acceptable-use-policy/)\r\n* **Privacy Policy**: [https://www.stablebox.com/privacy-policy/](https://www.stablebox.com/privacy-policy/)\r\n* **Terms of Service**: [https://www.stablebox.com/terms-of-service/](https://www.stablebox.com/terms-of-service/)\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\r\nABOUT US\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAbout the Stablebox Division\r\n-------\r\nHypernia Corporation ([https://www.hypernia.com](https://www.hypernia.com)) launched the Stablebox brand in early 2012 to specialize in providing enterprise class web hosting, cloud servers and dedicated servers to meet the ever growing needs of both individuals and businesses alike.\r\n\r\nStablebox has grown tremendously since its inception and has quickly become a leader in the web hosting industry.
