All inbound traffic is currently routed through Voxilitys Anti DDoS protection in both locations. I would like to inform you that we will most likely change the protection in London to a different solution soon while we keep Voxility in Frankfurt. Your machines will be DDoS protected in both locations though, now and in the future.\r\n\r\n**Special Plan**  \r\n- 2 vCPU Cores @ 3.5 GHz  \r\n- 512 MB ECC RAM  \r\n- 15 GB Pure SSD Storage  \r\n- 500 GB Traffic / month @ 1 Gbps port  \r\n- 12 EUR per year  \r\n- Frankfurt or London locations  \r\n**[ORDER NOW &gt;](https://cloud.nodion.com/machines/new?code=5RAFVAVPTJ&amp;plan_id=72)**\r\n\r\nPricing in EUR.
