Gigabit connectivity.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 of these servers available for now. Let see how it works. \r\n\r\nPlan: VZ3\r\nCPU: 1 Core\r\nRAM: 384MB\r\nVSwap: 384MB\r\nHard Disk: 12GB\r\nIP addresses: 1\r\nDedicated internet bandwidth: 2000 GB\r\nOS: Linux \r\nDistribution: debian or centos\r\nControl Panel: SolusVM\r\nVirtualization: OpenVZ\r\nType: Unmanaged\r\nPrice: \u20ac4.50 | $5.85 / monthly \r\n\r\n\r\nPlan: VZ5\r\nCPU: 2 Core\r\nRAM: 512MB\r\nVSwap: 512MB\r\nHard Disk: 20GB\r\nIP addresses: 1\r\nDedicated internet bandwidth: 3000 GB\r\nOS: Linux \r\nDistribution: debian or centos\r\nControl Panel: SolusVM\r\nVirtualization: OpenVZ\r\nType: Unmanaged\r\nPrice: \u20ac5.50 | $6.90 / monthly\r\n\r\nYou can order there:\r\nhttps://www.prometeus.net/billing/cart.php?gid=7\r\n\r\nPaypal only.\r\n\r\nWe are located in Italy, Milan.\r\n\r\n*** Download test can be run with the following urls ***\r\n\r\nhttp://mirrors.prometeus.net/test/test10.bin\r\nhttp://mirrors.prometeus.net/test/test100.bin\r\nhttp://iperweb.net/test/test10.bin\r\nhttp://iperweb.net/test/test100.bin\r\n\r\n194.14.179.254 and 195.88.4.7 can be used for network tests.\r\n\r\nNo IPv6 for now, we already got our PI /48 but haven't deployed it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should be all. If you need more info ask, PM, or open a ticket.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nS."}
