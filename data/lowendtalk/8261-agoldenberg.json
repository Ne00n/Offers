That being said we have 20GB of RAM left on this box. This offer has been updated to reflect this. \r\n\r\nAs I stated before we are new to this business, but stick with us and we will do everything we can to keep you satisfied. The offer is now 2GB/4GB and the HDD issues are being looked at.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your patience and your advice @CVPS_Kevin &amp; @CVPS_Luc\r\n\r\n\r\n*****END***********\r\n\r\n2 CPU Cores\r\n2048 MB of Dedicated RAM\r\n4096 MB of Burstable RAM\r\n60 GB of Disk Space\r\n100 Mbit Network Port\r\n2 TB of Bandwidth\r\n1 IPV4\r\n\r\nNY Test File: http://192.157.56.147/test500.zip\r\nNY Test IP: 192.157.56.147\r\n\r\nKansas City Test File: http://204.27.58.162/test500.zip\r\nKansas City Test IP: 204.27.58.162\r\n\r\nOrder Link: http://billing.digitaleh.ca/order.php?o=vps\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions!"}
