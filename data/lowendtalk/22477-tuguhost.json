But in Tuguhost, we give quality and friendly support to help you.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSome of review about company :&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo far I haven\u2019t seen a single downtime which really impressive. I thought I might get 1-2 down-times a month since it\u2019s ultra cheap but so far I have had 100% uptime.  So as my first month TuguHost vps review I can say everything is great and I\u2019m really happy with their service.

Better than I expected because I received replys for all most all questions in ticket system within an hour and most of it within  30 minutes. It's an un-managed vps which costonly $20 so I was not expecting a lot. I hope support will stay like this.\"\r\n[Source](http://find-cheapest-web-hosting.blogspot.com/2013/12/tuguhost-hosting-review.html)\r\n\r\nI use these guys for my Canadian cpanel webhosting and they rock. Rarely get any downtime, off site backups, one of best and cheapest hosting for my sites. It's not your generic setups they actually run things the way a company should. Haven't tried their vps but based on my webhosting service I wouldn't hesitate to try them, [Source](http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/14900/tuguhost-2-gb-ram-37-5-year-or-7-mo-1-gb-ram-25-year#latest)\r\n\r\nNext Our SPecial LET PLAN :&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSpecial 1 :&lt;br&gt;\r\nOpenVZ/SOLUSVM Control Panel&lt;br&gt;\r\nEqual Share CPU&lt;br&gt;\r\n20GB Diskspace&lt;br&gt;\r\n512 MB Guaranteed RAM &lt;br&gt;\r\n250 GB bandwidth &lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IP &lt;br&gt;\r\n$20/year&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Order Now](https://tuguhost.com/whmcs/cart.php?gid=1)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSpecial 2 :&lt;br&gt;\r\nOpenVZ/SOLUSVM Control Panel&lt;br&gt;\r\nEqual Share CPU&lt;br&gt;\r\n25 GB Diskspace&lt;br&gt;\r\n1 GB Guaranteed RAM &lt;br&gt;\r\n500 GB bandwidth &lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IP &lt;br&gt;\r\n$25/year&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Order Now](https://tuguhost.com/whmcs/cart.php?gid=1)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nSpecial 3 :&lt;br&gt;\r\nOpenVZ/SOLUSVM Control Panel&lt;br&gt;\r\nEqual Share CPU&lt;br&gt;\r\n50 GB Diskspace&lt;br&gt;\r\n2 GB Guaranteed RAM &lt;br&gt;\r\n1000 GB bandwidth &lt;br&gt;\r\n1 IP &lt;br&gt;\r\n$7/mo or $40/year&lt;br&gt;\r\n[Order Now](https://tuguhost.com/whmcs/cart.php?gid=1)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nTest IP : &lt;br&gt;\r\nLos Angeles : 192.210.195.18 &lt;br&gt;\r\nDallas : 192.227.137.57 &lt;br&gt;\r\nUK : 185.38.44.48 &lt;br&gt;\r\nBufallo : 192.3.203.35&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAny Question ?
