I noticed that nobody mentioned about this offer. So I decided to post it here.\r\n\r\nOffer text from WHT thread-\r\n\r\n&gt; Dual Quad Core Xeon 5420 (2.5Ghz, 8 physical cores)\r\n&gt;8GB RAM\r\n&gt;250GB SATA Hard Drive\r\n&gt;100Mbit Unmetered Port\r\n&gt;5 usable IPv4 IPs\r\n&gt;Linux\r\n&gt;Free Love\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;$0 Setup - $39 per month when you use the code: 15off\r\n\r\nI got my server about 2 weeks ago. With dual 250 GB HDD it costs $45/month which, I think, is a very good deal."}
