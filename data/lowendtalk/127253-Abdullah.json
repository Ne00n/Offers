Nothing too complicated but these are limited to the next 72 hours. To order, just &lt;a href=\"https://manage.hosthatch.com\"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; and add credit, then request\r\nfor your server to be provisioned via ticket (should not take more than a couple hours to get you set up).\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nOpenVZ (only Stockholm)\r\n1 shared CPU core @ 3.5 GHz\r\n128 MB RAM\r\n15 GB SSD (RAID-10)\r\n0.5 TB bandwidth\r\n$12 per year\r\n+ free doubled RAM and bandwidth\r\n+ add 768 additional RAM for $4 per year (total 1 GB)\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nKVM (only Amsterdam)\r\n1 CPU core @ 2.8 GHz (12.5% dedicated)\r\n0.5 GB RAM\r\n5 GB NVMe (RAID-10)\r\n0.25 TB bandwidth\r\n$15 per year\r\n+ free Voxility DDoS protected IP \r\n+ free doubled RAM and bandwidth\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nKVM (only Amsterdam)\r\n1 CPU core @ 2.8 GHz (25% dedicated)\r\n1 GB RAM\r\n10 GB NVMe (RAID-10)\r\n0.5 TB bandwidth\r\n$30 per year\r\n+ free Voxility DDoS protected IP \r\n+ free doubled RAM and bandwidth\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nKVM (only Amsterdam)\r\n1 CPU core @ 2.8 GHz (50% dedicated)\r\n2 GB RAM\r\n20 GB NVMe (RAID-10)\r\n1 TB bandwidth\r\n$5 per month\r\n+ free Voxility DDoS protected IP\r\n+ free doubled RAM and bandwidth (on semi-annual or higher payment)\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nOpenVZ server comes with 1 IPv4 and /64 IPv6. KVM servers come with 1 IPv4, 1 DDoS protected IPv4, /64 IPv6 and 1 private IP address. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: A full CPU core is assigned in all cases. Bursting more than your dedicated limit is possible. We will generally never really need to throttle you to the dedicated limit unless you really are abusing the CPU.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.hosthatch.com/features for more details. This is a 72-hour promotion and applies to new orders in the 72 hour period only."}
